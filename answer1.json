        "content": "    *I apologise in advance if my post violates any of the millions of rules I had to read before posting. This is my first post.* I like the fact that Riot tries to remain relevant and keep the game updated and fresh, both for newcomers and veterans alike. I liked especially the decision to add more flavor to the game by introducing featured modes. OFA was simply ok. URF was amazeballs. OFAM was a reiteration of an ok mode, so it only gets an \"eh\". Doom bots was only good until you got the icon. **But Ascension, that is the worst of all.** * First off, if you have played more than 4-5 Dominions, you are used to the circular lane. Now suddenly this lane is blocked, but not by walls, but by shadow (sand) and you can't see it until you're cornered by the entire enemy team. * Second, this game requires that you get all the extremely op picks (assassins and brutal fighters that post-1 item are unbeatable) to win. Like Katarina, Akali, Yasuo, Vi, Rengar, Poppy, Khazix, Fizz, Riven. You are bound to have more than 2 in your game. Unless.. * You have to ban champions. Oh wow really. I get to ban 3 (let's say 6) champions out of the huge \"stupid op\" pool. No. I want the entire op pool out. I mean, some champs are pretty eh until they get an item or two. Well, now they can. * Xerath is too easy to steal. Just walk up to it and start the DOTting with Cass or Teemo or Singed, or the DPS with Yasuo, Vi, Rengar and it's Ascension for you. If you want to be sneaky about it, just Tristana it before they know. There should be a barrier raising around Xerath when he gets the first damage. Not 360 barrier, just 2-3 walls so that the enemy team has to actually burn some calories before they can steal the Xerath. So should you. * It has an extremely high learning curve. Teaching yourself control and holding back from that 1hp Orianna and grab that Relic of Shurima takes more than 2-3 games to get used to. Speaking of which.. * Relics of Shurima take *too* long to capture, especially if you think about their respawn rate. Make them harder to contest than poking with projectiles. This is my feedback. I've played several ascensions, carried few of them, got all the icons because I wanted to learn the mode, see what it has to offer and get used to it before making an opinion. ~~And to quote EUNE's favorite quote, this mode is \"noob fookin cancer\".~~",

Also  #163;2 monthly fees. My only other options seem to be * BMSavings ([IS Extra, 1,59% p.a](http://www.bmsavings.co.uk/savings/isa-savings/918/isa-extra-issue-12-monthly-interest.aspx?WT.ac=BMSAOIEI1-918)), but they require a national insurance number which I don't have (I'm new to UK) * [NS amp;I](http://www.nsandi.com/savings-direct-isa), 1,50% p.a. No disadvantages found so far here. edit: I need a national insurance nr. here as well, so that's probably not an option anymore. edit: so if the named three accounts are somewhat out of question, my next best option would be [Online Saver/Post office](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/savings-accounts/online-saver), 1,4% p.a.

        "content": "    I am tired of losing. I am tired of feeling like a sack of shit. This is my story. I moved to Canada from India back in 2015, I was ready to make it big in life and thought life was going to be amazing after moving to Toronto. Enrolled in a post graduate program at a college in Toronto, life was fine as a student. I had never gambled in my life but I was curious about it as I always saw odds being displayed while watching my favorite sports(MMA, Soccer, etc) on TV. In August 2015, I opened an account on a Canadian sportsbook (Sportsinteraction), and I was a low limit player. I would bet on Soccer and MMA. I would bet like 20 bucks on crazy parlays, but it was just once a week so I never felt bad about it. Started dating my wife in 2016 and kind of forgot about gambling for a while as love is something you don't come across all the time. Started gambling again in 2017 and was still a low limit player. In 2018, I realized that I was getting tired of the rat race and I wanted to make big money so I thought maybe gambling would be the way to do it as I was good at predicting outcomes for the sports I was interested in. Problem is , I was always betting on parlays, as greed always beat the shit out of my practicality in my head. I would always go for the higher odds and I would end up Losing. My bets increased from 20$/week to 300$/week. I was still okay because I had a steady job and I had about 40-50k in savings. Then I made the worst decision of my life, I moved from Toronto to a small city in Atlantic Canada (Saint John,NB). New garbage city, no friends, a new high stress job (transportation planning), I wanted to make fast money and buy my wife a house(been her dream since she moved to Canada as well). 2019, I made 60k from my job, I didn't see a single penny from this income end up staying in my bank account for too long as I would gamble 500-1000$ a week on stupid parlays and never win. When I would bet on 1-2 games with heavy favorites, I would still lose as the underdogs would pull off massive upsets and at those moments I would think maybe god/the universe is out to get me. I still had 40-50k left over in savings from the previous years when 2020 came about. I thought to myself that maybe this is the year that i get it all back. Then the coronavirus hit and all sports stopped, i didn't know what to bet on anymore. That's when I discovered blackjack, I don't trust RNG so I thought I would play on the live tables and make some cash. The first two weeks were bad. I lost around 15k in those two weeks and I thought I should stop. But the pain of losing 30-40k in the past 3 years and the idea that I could somehow recover those losses convinced me to give it another shot. I developed a strategy and started playing again. My strategy worked, I made 1500$-2000$ per day and I was up to 20k, I was thinking to myself \"I can make 60k per month from this shit\". I was going to withdraw 15k the next day, but somehow thought to myself maybe I should play another hand before I withdraw this cash, I lost a couple hundred bucks and wanted to get it back, kept on losing for the next two hours and then lost all of the 20k I had make in the past week. I was so pissed, in those moments you feel like this is a cruel joke being played on you and someone is watching from somewhere and laughing at you. April, May and now June. Every day of the past three months I have been depositing 300-1000k into my account and gambling on blackjack trying to win my money back. Some days, I make 2-3k and end up losing it all a day or two later. I hate myself and feel like shit. My wife keeps reminding that we have to buy a house in Toronto next year as she is sick of this small town and wants to move back to the big city and doesn't want to pay rent anymore. She has no clue that I only have 100$ left in my checking account. I do have some savings in my retirement account (10k) that I cannot touch unless I go to the bank and I don't plan on doing that. But I have effectively destroyed my life. I could have been having 100-130k in savings right now but I am sitting here alone in my kitchen, with nothing left in my bank account. I have been having vivid suicidal thoughts for the past two months and I am very close to writing a suicide note for my family and friends. I don't know how I could break the news to my wife about my gambling addiction as she would probably not be able to handle such devastating news. I have a 2yr old son with her and the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of the guilt I feel when I think of abandoning them. I have become a shell of who I used to be, I used to be funny, smart and I could always make people feel comfortable in my presence. Now i don't interact with anyone and am always glued to my phone, gambling my money and possibly my life away. I don't know what to do anymore. This could be the end of my story.",

Boyfriend and I live in an 800 sq ft ground floor apartment and we are looking to adopt our first dog together. I had ACDs growing up but we had land to run and always had multiple dogs to play together. I am worried about trying to bring an ACD into a small apartment because I am familiar with the requirements of the breed. We are an active couple that hikes and climbs and we are usually outside somewhere on the weekends. We are looking for a breed that could accompany us on our adventures. I am hesitant mostly because we have a small space with no yard and we both work 9-5 during the week. Our apartment does have a dog park and we have access to running and walking trails right outside our door. I would never want to put a dog in a situation where it won't thrive but I love the breed and would love to have another one. Any advice on this is appreciated!",

The glass bed on that printer is removeable, so I proved myself wrong by sliding it around underneath the nozzle and it maintained a consistent distance. When I realized this I was able to troubleshoot and find that the actual issue was there was some vertical \"play\" on the extruder assembly that I had noticed and thought was odd at first but then forgotten about. I don't know if I'm explaining it well, but basically as the extruder moved along the X axis the wiring would build up some slight tension and actually lift the assembly maybe .5-1mm. So I thought I was leveling at each of the corners, but in reality I was setting the bed with a slope that would drag in the middle but print fine at each corner.",

        "content": "    I like the new direction taken by Android SDK guys. Here is some feedback about the presentation. * You don't need code generation to call (compose) functions. Why not just take Anvil approach instead of code generation? It is declarative, you can actually compose functions by calling them. Or am I getting something wrong? * All these @Composable functions are mutating a singleton. That makes it hard/impossible to parallel them if you want (you mentioned you wanted parallel execution for some reason), and it can also be a source of bugs when you're calling @Composable functions without treating the singleton's lifecycle. I like AnkoContext approach more, when you're passing the mutable state explicitly (though it can be significantly simplified and optimized for the new UI toolkit). A better (from my point of view, especially if you want multi-threading) solution could have methods like this:  #8203; ComposableUI().apply { storyWidget(stotyData) // the actual rendering }.updateView(rootView) * Adding LiveData into the mix, starting asynchronous operations inside UI - it all just breaks everything that was said in the introduction about responsibilities, event directions and having a single source of truth. It looks like the introduction came from Redux world, but the rest is a mix of different reactive patterns that are opposite to having the single source of truth. I'd like new UI toolkit to be more friendly to Redux and single source of truth (single source of data). * \"because code is data\". Was it a buzzword from LISP? In Kotlin code is not data. We do not have macro system or even \\`eval\\`. Overall, I like the new API more than the current.",

Yes, slots and my machine are thrilling (in my mind) but I just dont want this for my life anymore, not to mention my finances (oy). This site (as in you guys) is helping a great deal, thank you all for being so candid, and Im checking in here daily. Zero urges thankfully. I decided prior to New Years that I wanted to stop, already had New Years Eve plans at the casino of course (with family) and I allowed those plan and allowed a final gamble. Barely gambled New Years Eve, won about $2000 in half an hour and walked away with my winnings about 10 minutes later. I felt detached and turned off by the casino. Im amazed at all the THINKING Ive been doing since stopping and my strong desire to stop as well. Like thawing out, Im not so numb. I like it. Its very early on but day by day is my goal. Went to GA a few years ago and it just wasnt for me it wasnt resonating, however, I also wanted to keep gambling back then. Im on the lookout for any kind of online gambling meeting including GA. Ordered a gambling workbook to help me it just arrived and ordering Carrs book on gambling today. Lets keep on keeping on folks. : )",

        "title": "    Mossberg 590 Shockwave Question",
        "content": "    Question for you NFAers interested in the Mossberg 590 First off, I love this gun. I think it's a great \"work around\" gun to the NFA SBS that mossberg created. That being said, I know the wording the ATF used for the definition was that it did not have a stock on it from the factory with a 14\" barrel with 26\" total length, therefore it is a \"Firearm\". However I recently saw [this](https://usa.caagearup.com/msat500-shotgun-stock-grip-mossberg) and [this](http://www.brownells.com/handgun-parts/recoil-parts/recoil-hardware/sob-47-pistol-stabilizing-brace-fde-sku100024266-98277-199570.aspx?cm_mmc=cse-_-Itwine-_-shopzilla-_-100-024-266 amp;utm_medium=cse amp;utm_source=connexity amp;utm_campaign=itwine amp;utm_content=100-024-266) My question then becomes this. Does adding this pistol grip with the intention of adding the arm brace keep this weapon classified as a \"firearm\" so long as the stabilizing brace is not shouldered? I know the ATF had the [opinion letter](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Barnes-Stabilizing-Brace-Letter-Final-3.21.17.pdf) released that those braces are allowed to be shouldered, so would this also therefore reclassify the 590 shockwave an SBS which requires the tax stamp? I'm asking because I'm seriously considering purchasing a second Shockwave (they're still only $450ish) then getting my paperwork together to PGO it with the tax stamp and wait period. The purpose would be to keep one stock 590 in the truck because when I visit my family out of state, I can take the stock 590 and pass through states without notifying the ATF of my movement with the NFA item. However, if I can get the brace and the stock (total cost of $183 plus shipping from brownells and CAA), I'd save $200-250 and the wait period. As a side note, I'd still like to get a pistol arm brace for the shotgun anyways. It would make shooting it one handed much easier. I have done it before, and aside from good grip strength, you need to have some serious boulder shoulders to hold the thing up straight for any longer than 10 seconds to aim it",

When we lose, its the world slapping us back down, telling us we arent special. Gambling isnt the one to decide this about us, its a money making scam thats perpetuated by the casinos and governments.

In September 2016 I was driving an Enterprise Car Club (hourly rental) car in London and on my way to return it to its parking spot a GUY parked on the left side of the road opened his car door (right hand side, drivers side) into the left side of my vehicle as I proceeded down the road. The road was parked up on both sides. The car and door brushed against each other at more more than 5-10 mph. The damage to his door was exceedingly minor, effectively the lip was a little bent out. The damage to the Enterprise car was a deeper scratch and dent in the left side of the left wing. The claimant for personal injury was the passenger of this vehicle (on the otherside of the vehicle to where the collision occurred). She was not phased at the time of the incident and after all her boyfriends shouting and swearing at the time, she wandered off about an hour after. I denied liability for the collision at the time, reported it to Enterprise, filled in their statement forms and provided all the photo evidence. I didn't hear a peep since September 2016 and thus considered it closed. Then I get this letter dated October 2017, but it was sent to an old address and I only got hold of it yesterday 13/11/17. It advises that DWF will be representing me and that I may need to go and give evidence in court etc. I'm quite concerned as the excess is 750-1000 I think and I can't really afford this. I also don't need the stress of dealing with this and going to court etc. Beyond this the claim is a load of rubbish as she was on the passengers side to the site of the collision (drivers side), the damage was so minor that the car was in no way jolted by the incident and I do not see how she can credibly claim for injury. I'm quite concerned about this as I always hear about people claiming for whiplash etc and getting pay outs. Any thoughts or advice that can be offered would be much appreciate. Many thanks",

        "content": "    Throw away account. So I am in a guild that is quite successful at TW. In the last TW, we were facing a comparable guild. We routinely beat guilds with much higher GPs, so we didn #8217;t think much of it. As the battle wore on, our top players were getting beaten by toons they usually dominate on a consistent basis. Our opponents #8217; D was pretty much all meta, yet they were slicing through our meta with ease (we had a whole zeta bastilla node that got one shotted). Fleet was no different. Ultimately they didn #8217;t beat us by much, but any time we made progress, they seemed to have an answer. Once we hit their back row, they took out three back row meta with one shot each to clear the node, and should not have been able to do so after what it took to get there. It #8217;s like they were trying to not be too obvious and only trying to stay ahead by a little bit. After getting suspicious, we went to the guild #8217;s forum page, and noticed that they had posted game mods for download. We are pretty sure they were using hacks and mods, which would explain our performance. We reported this to @Lucifer. Anyone else have a similar experience?",

I think since this is new, it's worth thinking through what factors might be causing it. Is he at a new school? New teachers? New curriculum? Hanging around with new friends? Being bullied? See if there is something in his current situation that could be addressed without pulling him into a new school. That is a drastic step, and without understanding the underlying cause of all this, he could still have the same problems in the new school.",

If your provider is providing you with a mobile app you can easily start taking calls of your virtual extension on your mobile phone whether it #8217;s iOS or android. You #8217;ll not be charged in this scenario since you #8217;re just taking calls on your mobile phone using the app and the cellular internet. 2: lets suppose if your company doesn #8217;t provide you with an app option for your smartphone which is very weird  #128514; Or you don #8217;t have a smartphone(that #8217;s even more weird) but it #8217;s okay some people like to keep it simple. In this case you can just simply divert your virtual number calls to your mobile phone and you #8217;ll be charged by your VoIP provider for the minutes of call you #8217;re going to receive on you mobile phone not by your cellphone service provider.

        "content": "    This post is all over the place, but I felt like sharing my story others can relate and no that they really are not alone! Before I start: Please don't get me wrong and think I come from some rich family and my parents are Doctors and giving me thousands in allowance, that is now true. I work hard for every dollar I make! I am thankful that I found and still have a very well paying job and it will take me a year to get back to where I was when I started gambling, but the pain is strong just like someone who lost it all with much less saved up. I just turned 21 and I am just hit rock bottom, or so I thought I did. Cash Advance - the worse feature of a credit card for a gambler. You see I thought once I hit $0 in the bank last week that would be all, I walked out of the casino in great spirits and ready to start a new chapter! Most people would be ready to kill themselves but I was the opposite, I was so happy and felt like some kind of burden was taken off my shoulders and as I was driving home I felt like a million bucks, even though I had $0 to my name! This high lasted a few days until I got paid and that urge came back to go, which I did....I went with $4,000 and at what point was up $8,000! Of course as we all know ''the house always wins'' and I ended up losing all of that $4,000 and then proceeded to take out $3,000 in cash advance...as you know I lost that , too. Before gambling I had saved over $60,000 was living fine , life was moving. I got a nice car, which thankfully I still have. Money was just a number like the numbers on the clock. I was thinking of moving out, getting a nice place that would cost $3,000 a month, get nice furniture have a game room, you get the point, living the good life. I was always looking for more ways to make money and gambling never crossed my mind. I have friends who always asked me to go to the casino with them, but it never interested me for some odd reason. One day I was bored and in the area of the casino.... A big mistake I made that day: I walked into the casino, something I wish to this day I would have never done. But what can a $500 loss do already? I HAD so much saved up! As you can imagine, I went in and lost that $500, what repeated after was relatable to anyone who is struggling with gambling, I wasted over $2k that day but that didn't phase me at all, I left and went to my hotel. Next morning comes and I just have this crazy urge to go back I give in go back and lose another $2k. Now for about a week I was fine as I was so occupied with work after vacation that i didn't even remember #160;about the losses but then the following weekend I went again and lost $5k in a single night. Now keep in mind you generally do not lose $1k at one time, it is over the course of a few machines. Going once a week led to going 5-7 times a week losing $500-$1k each time! I did enjoy myself there meeting a whole bunch of interesting characters that wasted even more money than I have but as you leave reality sets back in to place. There is no concept of money once you step food into a casino, any sense of value is outside those casino doors. I refused to buy myself a pair of shoes because they were $5 more than last time, yet I go to the casino and gamble 10x that! Around the time I started going to the casino I was in a relationship, things were rocky and we ended up breaking it up. I was devastated and shifted my focus to the casino. The timing of me going to the casino to which I had never gone before, and breaking up a month later worsened the situation a lot. I am not one to blame anyone or thing but myself! I am grown, and make my own decisions, I chose to let it get out of control and now I am suffering from this depression. I used to be the one helping other and now I have to now borrow $400 to pay a bill off that way I do not get charge interest for a late fee, how the wheel has turned. It makes you feel dead inside, you lose all life to you. Depression comes and goes, but when it is here, it hits hard! My biggest issue is that I am afraid of myself, I lose total control and go crazy! I have lost 4k in a matter of 2 hours! That is insane! I have told myself so many time that I am done, but I kept going back. At this point I have to pay off the 3k for the Cash Advance I took out yesterday. Learning the value of money is hard. I have trouble falling asleep, I wake up sad. I push through the day, sad and grumpy, and get my work done. I am just existing at this point, the spark has left and is waiting to be reignited. It will take 2-3 months for me to look at my bank and smile again, but I did this to myself and am now paying the consequence. I feel like writing this out helps me a bit and I truly hope someone will see this and know we can get through this. Has anyone else hit rock bottom and felt great, then a few days later it hit you like a ton of bricks? Any advice for me? Thanks in advance!",

Ive been beating myself up the past day about the money I lost. Like the other comment said, its an expensive lesson and if you dont want to bury yourself in more debt and feel this way again just cut your losses and work your ass off to pay it back. Money comes and goes man. Just quit gambling. Ive quit like 6 times and I need to quit forever. Odds never in your favor. House always wins. Take care and dont beat yourself up too much.",

        "content": "    Hey folks. This is my first time on Reddit, so I'm sorry if the writing is bad. Anyhow, to the story! A little background, I am in high school and recently got my first car. A Dodge Shelby CSX. It's a speedy little 2 door with an I4 turbo. Nothing special. I got it for dirt cheap too. I found my first job a few months ago in a wealthy area in Kansas, so there's already an entitlement vibe. Me is me, ep is entitled person, and Fred is the manager. It was a rather cold day in October and I was on my regular weekend shift. About 2pm comes around and I see a stylish Jaguar xe-s pull into a spot across the lot next to my little CSX. The man opens his door and taps my car and I grit my teeth a little. He gets out and looks at my car then walks inside. Me: Hello sir, can I help you today? Ep: Yes, I'm here to pick up some chocolate I ordered? Me: Okay, I'll run to the back to see if it's ready. Fine right? Just some nice guy picking up some candy? Nope! I come back with his chocolates in a bag for him to take home. Me: Here you are sir, is there any- Ep: Ya know it would've been real nice to have someone help me out while I waited. Me: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm the only worker here besides the manager right now. I can help you now if you'd like. Ep: Oh no, I'm fine thank you (sarcasm). Grunts* Ah, sorry, I'm just in a bad mood, some trash parked out there too close to my spot. Poor people shouldn't park where we do. Me: That CSX out there is mine if that's what you're referring to. He looks stunned like 'you work here and drive that?' Ep:Oh my god(with laughter). What does that even stand for. Me: uh, Carroll Shelby eXperimental? Ep: Jesus, that can't be yours, not a Shelby. That thing would set you back like 50 grand. Me: Uh, no it was actually less than 5. Ep: laughs* I guess Fred heard the laughter and came outside. Fred: what's going on? Ep: Oh nothing, just your employee stole a car. I was shocked and my blood ran down to my feet. Fred: What? Ep: That Shelby out there. He stole that. Me: Uh, first off that's my car, thank you, I have the key and registration, and secondly if you think a 90s economy car is worth 50 grand you're crazy. Ep: did you just talk back to me? Me: Yes I did, I'm standing up for myself so we can de-escalate this whole deal. Ep: god you're a nerd. Fred: Okay, I think you should leave sir. Ep: fine, but I'm not coming back. Walks out door. As he goes to get in his car, he looks back at me, smiles, then smashes his door into mine. He then peels out of the parking lot. In the end, I got a warning from Fred and fixed my door with a Ding King (as advertised by Billy May), and never saw Ep again. Honestly he acted more of a scumbag than an entitled person. I know this wasn't the best material, but I hope you all enjoyed!",

Sure you can use the text chat, but not everyone reads that and it #8217;s not the easiest thing to do when you #8217;re being shot at. So how about a second voice chat button (in addition to the standard \"talk to your squad\" button) that works based on your proximity to another player, be it friend or foe. For arguments sake, say someone was within 5 metres of you, they would be able to hear you. You could warn a team mate of the enemy about to C4 your tank from behind. If you were feeling a bit cheeky, you could taunt that Sniper just before you stab him from behind. Not only would it aide game play, it would also add to its realism.",

        "content": "    Let me tell you my story. I am 31 and I started gambling when i was 26 after I had a hard time with a business that I owned. The failing of the business took me into a deep state of depression. At my store I started watching poker (wsop) world series because the business was too slow and got hooked into poker. In the beginning I enjoyed it then tried playing it. I was still in college while I owned my business and after a tough 8 months I sold it. I started working at a gas station and with my first paycheck went to play poker at a charity place. Lost all of it I did it for the next 6 months I worked there. I hated my job so I would keep going back to play poker because it made me feel alive. Then i graduated from college owing only $7000 due to my ability to spend less money . I only owed my last semester tuition as I started gambling in the last semester. Took me 1 year to pay my last semester tuition due to me losing all the time but I would still go back I probably lost 20k in that time period. Then I got a decent job started gambling less because I was happy with my life. Then one day I went to the casino and won $8000 playing bj. I was thrilled and got hooked to it. I had some savings totalling up to $30000. I was not getting an deserved raise at work so I quit my job to find a new job as I had some money. Then I started gambling heavy and lost 28k in a matter of month, I was shocked and needed a job. I finally found a job and stopped playing for a while. I let my girl take control of my expenses and she would not let me gamble for more than $200. And would call me relentlessly to keep a tab on me.I won again and would win for next couple of months I won a total of $20,000. It was fun I would go there not caring about losing but having fun I would only play bj and some days I would win $2000 - $4000 and if I loose only lost $200-$300 at once. I thought making money was easy. Then fast forward to new years my wife travelled for a couple of months to see her family I gave her $5000. And she left me with $15000 , I thought I had it under control but had thoughts about how i lost it all the last time . ci told myself I could keep the streak alive but I have lost all my money . I would go the casino with a $1000 and lose it every time some times I would go back to the casino to win the money back in the same night. Last night I lost every penny and had to borrow $500 from a freind to pay my bills. I am debt free only owe $500 which I will pay back from my next pay check. and I have never gambled with other peoples money. Somedays, recently with my wife away i would not leave the casino till I lost my last penny. I have understood that its not winning that makes me go back but the urge to play. I could go playing for 12 hours all night and go to work next day and work 10 hours without any sleep. I don't have a social life when I am alone all I want to do is gamble. I feel like its eating me alive. I can't get rid of this disease. I am starting to feel helpless and I dont want to this anymore. I got a second job to keep me busy all time . I dont want to go the casino any more I hate it. What should I do to quit for good. I dont want to join GA And is there correlation between depression and gambling ? Recently I have read lot of stories about people and their horrible losses. I also read about a guy who killed his whole family and himself because he owed a lot of money due to gambling. I knew all this but why did I still go back to the casino to loose my last penny . I hate myself for doing this to myself. Just wanted to vent a little bit because i could not keep it inside. Fuck gambling addiction it's the worse thing you can do to your self and your loved ones. Money is important I was flying high when I was winning but I crashed hard last night worst feeling ever. I hope they ban gambling and casinos as it does no good to anyone.",

        "content": "    From what I have gathered, the company FX distributed through a company called Vogue International, based out of Florida. FX has no website of their own, Vogue International also has no website of their own as far as I can tell. My ex had bought the Surf Head at our local CVS, so I went and they didn't have it. I asked and they said it was pulled a few months ago and they haven't had it around, but they had the smaller 2oz wax FX product. I didn't get any as I was reluctant to find some left over at another store. Apparently CVS did a reset to that isle in April and it was removed from their planogram. CVS's website has it as out of stock as well. I live on the border of VT and N.H. and a few weeks ago, a friend and I went down to New York and we ended up walking around and I went to the CVS in Lower Manhattan to see if they had it, they did not. I then have traveled to North Conway, N.H. for work and checked their location and they also did not have any, and mentioned that they had to pull it from their shelves, but kept the smaller green wax FX product. My next step is to call CVS themselves and see what is going on, if they can shed some light. Every time I search for what happened to the product on Google, all I get is people selling it from $35 to $75 dollars. I found it to be an amazing product so I am desperately trying to get it again. I also bought two of the 2oz wax and it so far has worked exactly the same. It has been a week and my hair has been consistent with this as it worked with the paste. The only difference is, that I have to use a lil more of the wax to work the same as the paste.",

I have been a user of h for over 3 years, last year i started on suboxone but kept relapsing and not using my sub causing me to lose scripts, this last stint goes like this. I have been on subutex instead of suboxone for 3 month, i have had 1 disaster caused by xanax* in that time, but no relapses in going back to h. Anyway, do you think its safe to stay on the subutex long term, as i am able to drink, eat,sleep, no withdrawls, except the benzo wd lingering. I am in the u.k so my script is free and i get sundays take home, i have to go every other day although its 5 mins from my house and my parents take me. I am concerend that thewithdrawls are going to be awful, and that is keeping me on them, although my keyworker from the drug clinic says i am doing fantastic and not to jepordise it. I really do not know what to do,i have come along way since my darkest days in addiction.",

I went through it carefully for 40 minutes, and answered each question honestly and completely. I started getting excited when I had reached 99%. Then I got a screen saying, sorry, the interview system was down. No swagbucks. I've heard of this crap happening to other people. Is it a good rule to avoid these huge payoff surveys? Would complaining to support help? Unfortunately, I didn't write down the survey number.",

These are games \"inspired\" by Darkest Dungeon. But in my opinion, they look too similar to DD. To be honest, they just look like rip-offs. Some niche developers think, that if Darkest Dungeon is popular, then they can use its pupolarity to earn some money themselves. No, more than that. If these games gain enough popularity, more and more DD clones will emerge from the abyss called \"Early Access\". I don't know, what can we do, but I don't want this to happen.

Like, all them were very attractive, beautiful even. Extremely well dressed. But, something was just off about them. Almost like they were droids or something. The thing that really stood out was they were all over each other, in a very sexual way. All of them. The brother and sisters. The Mom and daughters. The Mom and son. Same with the Dad. They were touching each other constantly and would kiss each other on the cheek, lips, and even the backs of each others necks. They were oblivious to other the other people in line. They never even noticed us staring at them for a solid 20 minutes. We couldn't even talk to each other we were so stunned at what we were witnessing. I still don't understand what I saw or even how to explain how weird it was to see. My stomach still turns when I think I about it.",

But would it be illegal (I am based in Spain)? I run a very small company and I am finding it tough to make ends meet and I really need this money that he owes me. I think I hold more power by threatening to do it than actually doing it, so I sent him a message pretending to be concerned about his health and saying I might ask around on Facebook. BTW - he is not even on my friends list so he will not have seen this one coming :-) UPDATE: The client has agreed to pay after I sent him the message about contacting his friends on Facebook. I immediately changed my settings to that only my friends can see who my friends are. Otherwise any person can contact all your Facebook friends!",

I feel like the biggest loser once I lose it all. I'm a middle aged woman (RN) that made the mistake of spending eight days in Vegas 2 years ago. Found my love of roulette! It's neverending. It's on my mind all day, everyday. I want to stop but I want to \"make up for the lost money\" which we all know it's impossible. This is my greatest secret. My love of roulette. Just walking in the casino gives me joy, but I walk out HOPELESS 99% of the time. It has ruined me financially. I hope you find a way to stop. Today was my 1st day of saying NO MORE.

I am aware of how Cataclysm's \"reality bubble\" works so I set up a tent next to the bike and slept during the day, only to wake up to the battery still being empty. Is there something I am doing wrong? does the solar panel somehow need to be hooked up to the battery in some way that I have overlooked? I'll supply any information about the bike if needed.",

Falstad presses Z for easy kill. and i could go on... I mean, what can i do? I can spot stealthers from miles, but it's not worth shit if i can't touch them. I can put E under me to stun melees, but that just postpones my death. Positioning? Where? Being in front/backline is no-go, she's way too squisy. Being at max range makes me extremely vulnerable to assassins. Only thing i've found that works is Medivh constantly peeling for me, but is it really it? I mean, she has good range and damage, but very long CDs and very limited CC... so, what am i missing?",

So I just started playing, I played some adventure and did some practise matches. Then I started to hop on to casual online games. And as I expected I soon played against very experienced players and veterans. I knew this would be happening and I know I just need to keep playing, practicing and become better and soon enough I will be able to compete on an even level. But I was thinking is there maybe a way I can play with some inexperienced players just like me? Is there a forum or a way I can queue with people of the same level? Secondly the character I try playing is shovel knight. I find his moveset very fun and interesting. But is this a good character to pick up at first? Besides that I am using my gamecubecontroller to play. Any tips on settings? And any fighting tips in general? (I played a lot of smash ultimate and watch smash videos daily so I kind off know the basics) Anyway thanks for reading en thanks for your reply I appreciate it! Have a nice day!",

        "content": "    I'm absolutely a compulsive slot player at a local Native American casino, all my discretionary income has gone there for years and I'm thousands of dollars in debt. I recently lost my job of 20+ years, and still found myself there gambling away my unemployment checks, simply insane. I received a thousand dollar cash gift from my parents for Christmas, and that's been a turning point for me as I obviously have no problem screwing myself over and over but the thought of blowing their money, given to me in pure kindness is a line I won't cross. I've thought about it long and hard, and find that the strongest trigger for me in deciding to go to the casino is the cheap cigarettes ($5 less per pack than in stores), and the ability to smoke inside like a normal human being. Smoking was banned in bars in my state in 2005 and that's exactly when I started regular casino gambling. I can't smoke in my apartment complex now either. On a daily basis I'll generally have 3 or 4 cigarettes a day, but go through at least an entire pack, almost two packs sometimes in a night of gambling. So much so that I always leave with a migraine. I hadn't thought of it this way before, but it's a lot like depressed people who cut themselves - it's that level of pain and distraction. So it's New Year's eve and I have exactly one cigarette left in a pack in my car for later tonight. Not drinking, so shouldn't be any surprise temptations later on. Just hanging home and likely re-reading Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking again. I have his gambling book too, but still feeling strong enough in my personal conviction about the grand that I don't want to hear all the tales right now. I will never understand how it is my brain loses the connection between money inside the casino and money outside the casino. I'll spend 5 minutes debating whether the cage-free eggs are worth the extra $1.50 at the grocery store. I would have a minor meltdown if I had an unexpected large auto repair bill or something medical that had to be paid out of pocket. Yet the opportunity to walk out the door \"up\" by $400 will be passed-up time and time again in exchange for a couple more hours of smoking and a few more trips to the ATM and that horrible drive home with a lighter bank balance and a splitting migraine. I feel good about my 9 days, and have gained a lot of insight from lurking in this sub. I wish you all a Happy New Year, here's hoping it's a better year for all of us.",

Anyhow, without giving you my life story, here it is: I've floated around producing over the years, gaining the majority of my experience from producing my own short films--which have had reasonable budgets (anywhere from $4k-24k) and worked with SAG, Film LA, locations. I've also line produced a few industrials for a particular production company that neared $140k for 4 and 5 day shoots. In that time (like any other producer), I've had some serious hurdles (page count, talent #'s, expensive locations, etc.) After 1st AD'ing and working on other various productions in other capacities (AP), I am very keen on becoming a legitimate line producer with an eventual goal of getting into the PGA. I really really enjoy the craft of producing and problem solving and I think this is where my talent lies. I know my experience is limited but who is going to trust me to anchor their 1.2 mil. indie feature from my standpoint? Where do you make the jump? Not to say I deserve that...but how do I prove myself to the next producer I'm trying to impress.  I do know it's all about reps, dealing with difficult variables/constraints/limits etc., but what is the best way to get to the next level. Is it schmoozing that next producer to trust you with their budget? Connections? How can you be taken seriously when your IMDB page isn't filled with a ton of TV and film credits? I'm hungry as hell and love the total absorption of putting a production together. Need any insight you all may have!",

        "content": "    \"What the...?\" I mumble to myself as I slowly stand up. Where am I? I look all around, trying to see anything that might give me a clue about what is going on. At first I thought I'd gone blind, but then I notice the two white doors an arm's length in front of me. Everything else is pure black nothingness. I don't mean \"someone turned the lights off and it's hard to see,\" I mean, it seems to just be emptiness. I can't see any shadows or walls or, well, anything at all except those doors and the blackness. After a long internal debate, I start to reach for one of the door knobs. I figure, maybe if I leave this room things will start to make sense, but just before making contact, I get this overwhelming sense of pure dread. I don't know what is going on, but something is telling me to get as far away from those doors as possible. Now. Without wasting another second, I turn my back to the door and start running. In the black nothingness, it's impossible to tell how much progress I'm making or how fast I'm going. Have you ever tried running when you literally can't see anything at all? It's got to be worse than just being blind, because oftentimes blind people can still at least see light and vague shapes. But running in this black nothingness? It's really disorienting, I can't tell if I'm going to run into a wall or fall off a cliff on my next step. My heart is pounding and my legs are weak, but I keep running because I'm still I'm afraid to turn back and see those doors behind me. I feel like I've been running for hours when I finally see another door in front of me. Just a single door this time. Ever so slowly, I stretch my hand out, waiting for that sense of dread to come back. Finally, my hand falls on the knob and I don't sense anything this time. Not having any other ideas, I turn the handle and take a step backwards as I watch the door swing open. Then I step inside.... What? This is not... I mean, I don't know what I expected, but THIS? This is certainly not it... There are file cabinets everywhere, as far as the eye can see. You know, those ugly metal storage drawer things you'd see in an office. Each one is several times taller than I am, and there are just rows and rows and rows of them. It looks like the rows go on for miles. But there's still not anything else visible, just that inky black nothingness surrounding these file cabinets. (Did someone drug me? This place makes no sense.) I open one of the drawers to look at the papers inside and notice the writing is not in any language I've ever seen. \"You're dead.\" Huh. No wonder I didn't recognize this place. I spin around, trying to see where that voice came from. I search for a long time, when I notice out of the corner of my eye, there's a vague silhouette in the direction where the voice came from. The outline is so faint that I can't see it when I look straight at it. While looking slightly off to the side of the shape, I asked, \"What is this place?\" \"This is what you would call the afterlife. This area, specifically, is the information storage center. We keep records here of every single thing that's happened on earth since the beginning of time. Now, it's time for you to go back and choose a door.\" \"Please wait, I have so many more questions! What are those doors...\" \\------------------ \"What the...?\" I mumble to myself as I slowly stand up. Where am I? I wonder about this deja vu feeling as I reach toward one of the doors and feel a growing sense of dread.",

I got pictures with them. I got to be on stage at the end for what they literally call the  #8220;Faygo Armageddon, #8221; where their crew brings out case after case after case of Diet Faygo for the VIPs to spray over everyone. I don #8217;t even know how to shake up and spray a fucking thing, because I #8217;m classy with a k, so all I end up doing is hiding in a corner of the back of the stage with a sweet Japanese exchange student and spray Diet Faygo all over the guys in front of me. They kept turning around to DRENCH me in Faygo probably because they were sick of being sprayed by me. After the Faygo Armageddon, I am literally drenched from head down into my shoes, and it was the funnest experience I #8217;ve had since going to Camp John Waters. It was seriously a blast and the two guys from ICP are very nice and gracious, the fans are kind, and I probably am over my obsession now but then again there is always  #8220;The Gathering #8221; as the final mountain to climb. It #8217;s so stupid it #8217;s fun. But I don #8217;t have to work the show. There was a literal lake of Faygo after the show. It was INSANE.",

If you want to read the last one, click [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3h615d/small_progress_was_had_despite_fuckarounditis_for/) **Background** 46 year old female, training for ~2.5 years. Primarily training the Oly lifts. Also play tennis, coach hockey, yoga and sometimes do a crossfit WOD (because I hate myself). ---------------------------------------------------------------- Here's what was going on last time: **Aug 2015** Body Fat - 30% (estimated from Navy Calculator) Waist size - 31\" Weight - 147 lbs Dress size: 8 no. of hours strength training / week: 4-6 (sporadic) Squat: [High Bar 48 kg](https://youtu.be/xafhGIwAyT0) Front: [39 kg](https://youtu.be/B4pH4ol54pw) Snatch: [28 kg] (https://youtu.be/GIkLMAA3k2E) Clean and Jerk: 37 kg (Gym PR w/no vid) Deadlift: [75 kg](https://instagram.com/p/5Sg-edo3UO/) [Recent pic](https://instagram.com/p/6OA3KzI3X-/) ---------------------------------------------------------- And here's what's happening now: **April 2016** Body Fat - 37.3% (measured on an impedance scale in my gym) Waist size - 31\" Weight - 148 lbs Dress size: 8 no. of hours strength training / week: 4-6 (sporadic) Squat: [High Bar 55 kg](https://youtu.be/_od5n72QKDU?t=37s) Front Squat: 1 RM is untested, but [here is a recent 5RM PR (32kg)](https://youtu.be/wJWySvQohGs?t=44s) Snatch: Probably still 28kg. [Vid of recent rep PR](https://youtu.be/1lEW657Wqcs) Clean and Jerk: Probably still around 37kg [Vid of recent clean rep PR](https://youtu.be/uAvDIwVea60) Deadlift: [80 kg](https://youtu.be/_od5n72QKDU?t=1m42s) --------------------------------------------------------------- **Training Routine** Last 6 months or more I've been using an on-line coaching service for Oly that includes personalized programming, video review. So far it has been pretty good and I plan on continuing it. I still play tennis and do yoga a few times a month. I've stepped up hockey coaching this spring, which isn't physically demanding (like a brisk walk) but definitely time consuming and does wear on my knees a bit. I'm really happy with how much more consistent my lifts have begun. I feel like they are much better technically. I've switched to dynamic starts which seem to have really helped my pull. I've done alot more upper back and core work. In general, I believe the foundation for my lifts is much more solid, but my squat is still a limiting factor for me. Fortunately it has improved but has a ways to go before my Oly lifts will improve. ------------------------------------------------------------------- **Goals** Long term goal is still to get my Oly total up to qualify for Master's Pan Ams A new goal is that if I stay a 69kg weight class and get about 8 kg on my total in a meet, I would actually set a MI state Master's record, since most old ladies don't lift. ------------------------------------------------------------------- **Muh Feels** I'm still struggling with weight. I actually blew up to 155lb and recently got back down. I am logging my food, tracking my protein. Turns out that my TDEE is lower than it was a few years ago, which might be age related, since my muscle mass is def more. I'm on a good trend now, and hopefully I'll be able to get down below 30% BF on the fancy gym scale. I'm fairly well convinced that the Navy Calculator is off by at least 5% BF. I'm also struggling with priorities. I love lifting and given the choice, I'd do it 4-5 days a week. But I also love coaching hockey and playing tennis, and I only have so much free time outside of work, so lifting is really 2-3 days a week. I'm grateful for finding a good on-line coach that actually appreciates cross training and programs for it. Hence the slow, but relatively steady progress that works with my schedule. I must say that lifting has definitely translated into a better tennis game. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- **TL;DR** Old lady Oly lifter gradually improving but still fat.",

I just couldn #8217;t. I was too consumed with my love for another that I forgot to love me. I was so consumed with the power he had over me. I couldn #8217;t move.

And when he really did leave me, I still didn #8217;t see the toxic poison that seeps in me. I saw only the void that filled the horizons of my soul and heard the slashing sound of a thousand knives, making its way through my aching heart. Days turn to weeks and weeks to months and months turn to years yet I still didn #8217;t heal. The wound was as fresh as ever. At that time, I figured that there really was no cure for heartbreaks. Until the day I saw my friend crying over a situation I used to be in and I had an epiphany. Why should I keep on loving someone who doesn #8217;t love me? Why should I care, crave and worry about someone who doesn #8217;t spare not even one second for me? Why should I mourn over a guy that put me on leash simply because he felt like it? Why should I lose myself over a guy that finds pleasure in hurting me?

        "content": "    Im only 25 this year, ever since I was young, Ive always loved to gamble, take risks, doing dares anything that ever involves the chance to win / lose! The greater the risk the more intense it gets, but i never back down or run. When i first turned 18 the legal age to gamble in Australia, I visited Crown Casino, placing small bets winning and losing, it was all for pure entertainment and just loved every moment i was there. As the years passed, my bets got bigger, when i started earning more money i started betting bigger, Ive gambled on everything, sportsbet bet, bitcoin, bitmex, plus500, stocks, everything you can think of, even runescape ! Looking back Ive lost over $300,000 aud, its a lot of money, Ive worked so hard yet all i did was gamble away that money! Over 40k in debts, credit card, personal loans, friends everything! Its bad losing my own money, but this year it spiralled down hill, my family sold our house to start a family restaurant, we all committed hard working up to 80-90hrs per week. Everyones so committed, they all trust me to handle all the family funds and yet Ive managed to lose everything, our entire house saving sold invested into our restaurant, its been almost a year we should have made over $150,000 yet instead of that + house savings when i check my account there is only 50k debt, I cannot tell anyone the truth, it would destroy us my family our work our future, Ive promised to quit so many times, Ive fully excluded myself from all online bookies, then found bitcoin, lost 50k + on that then closed my account, to lose 30k + on runescape, 100k at casino I dunno how i can live anymore! I dont want my family to find out, I dont want to break everything weve worked for, I just want to start again but Im not sure how, with so much debt and family planning to buy a house, what can i do, the truth will destroy everything! My family cannot handle such a big shock, this year alone is where Ive lost everything! I regret it so much, telling the truth is impossible! I have promised to quit this time once and for all 110% dedicate my time into our business and build it, but if the truth comes out when we try to buy our new house they will be broken. Im trying to fight my depression and regrets all alone its hard Dont gamble guys, its not worth it, little entertainment is not worth a life time of regrets and breaking those closest to you!",

I #8217;m here to eradicate the stigma surrounding STIs by sharing my experience and normalizing the conversation around sexual health. AMA!",
        "content": "    I #8217;m so excited to be able to answer any questions you may have on STIs and specifically, herpes! After working in public health for the last decade, I #8217;ve pretty much heard it all, and there #8217;s no topic or question that #8217;s too weird or too awk. Herpes, in particular, is something that carries a huge stigma with it, but it #8217;s largely unnecessary. Many people think that herpes is shameful (spoiler alert: it #8217;s not), because most of us are clueless about it, but it #8217;s a lot more common than you think, and it doesn #8217;t have to change or limit anything in your life. You may have seen my work in outlets like: The Washington Post, CNN, Cosmopolitan Magazine, Forbes, NPR, Rolling Stone, Refinery 29, The Daily Mail, Bustle, Elite Daily, The Today Show, and many more. So, let #8217;s chat about all things herpes and STDs/STIs: from prevention, safer sex, and transmission risk to disclosure and stigma, I #8217;ve got you covered! You can see some proof and more of myself and The STI Project: Here - https://www.instagram.com/subject3187/ And here - https://linktr.ee/subject3187/ 11:00pm EST Edit: Hey ya'll, I #8217;m signing off for now, but thank you so much for all of your questions! I #8217;ll be doing a Facebook Live tomorrow at 8.30PM EST where I'll be discussing genital herpes with Dr Shepherd, Jaya Jaya Maya, and Alexandra Harbushka. However, I'll be checking back earlier in the day to answer any questions I've missed, so please keep them coming! Follow [this Facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/FemiClear/) to tune in to tomorrow's LIVE event!",

I think you put more words to my thoughts and thinks I was on the edge of. It's the tone that goes with the term racist, it just doesn't make sense for what I use maps for. I don't have any feeling about cardinal directions other than it helps standardize things. I personally find northern facing projections the most useful because it offers a neutral fixed point where most land mass is. The arctic is not my study area, but it is useful reference point. People have used these tools for different reasons through time and modern perceptions are reflections on decisions made in history. I guess orientation does affect western cultures because they take actions with those interpretations, such as housing choices. I think that recognizing these things is important and it boils down to a societal education problem, not the maps themselves. It just is so absurd to fixate on this item when the issue goes so much deeper.",

        "content": "    26 M unmarried here. I never used to be a gambler before this. I had about $16k savings for one and half year. So I started gambling early last month and made a profit of about $2k gambling online playing roulette and blackjack. I had been saying I will quit but always end up gambling until I lost about $500 of my profit. I was super tilted chased my losses and lost the other $1.5k profit and another $1.5k of mine. I was frustrated and I said I was going to quit gambling only to resume gambling the next day. I kept on chasing throughout the days, won it all back plus a profit of $400. I couldn't stop. The idea of stopping was not even in my mind at this time. I was flying high. I felt incredible. Four days later I have a bad streak and lose about $4k. I was devastated, didn't gamble the whole of the next day. I \"almost\" quit. Then the next night I relapsed and luckily won all the $4k back. I was super excited. I told myself this is a second chance you have been given, don't gamble anymore, quit gambling as you have all your money back now. I didn't gamble for one whole day only to relapse again and lost the $4k back. Chased it throughout the days until I lost about $10k within a week. Today I converted $500 into $2k only to lose it all in 5 mins and another extra $2k just about an hour ago. I only have $1.2k left for now. I just feel super devastated but I also feel calm and contented as I don't have any more money to gamble and there is no way I can convert the 1.2k left into 16k. I cannot even stand looking at my account balance anymore. Good thing is I am not in debt but will have to work my ass again for about 7 months to win back all the money I had lost. I pray I will successfully quit and not relapse again to try and chase the loss and get myself in debt. I will be posting my progress on this sub. I pray I will succeed.",

        "title": "    My BPPV Story - in hope it somehow helps others.",
        "content": "    My story is long, so I'll try to keep it short. But I hope it can at least help others through their journey. My first bout of BPPV was a bit over 2 years ago. I went to bed and started spinning, got up to get help, fell to the floor, threw up - and was taken to the ER. It was the middle of the night and the ER folks seemed to be a tad upset I interrupted their midnight card game. I did a urine and blood test (as I'm sure they thought I was on drugs). I was given Meclazine (Antivert) and Zofran and sent home, being told to follow up with my primary doc in a week. Eventually the dizziness went away and at this point, I really had no clue what was going on. I was just thankful that after a few weeks I felt better. Fast forward a bit over a year later I had two more episodes. When the BAD vertigo first hit, I knew what was happening this time and stayed still - turned a light on, and stared at one spot on the wall. Again - eventually the dizziness subsided. I also made an appointment with an ear specialist as the summertime 3rd episode was dragging on. As the vertigo subsided, my ears started popping, sloshing, and fluttering. By the time I saw the ENT specialist, I was fine. Ears tested ok. I've had tinnitus for many years - so that was nothing new. Note - my grandmother had Meneires disease, so this was a concern for me. This last episode that started in December has been a doozy. It happened while in bed, in the morning. The intense 30 second vertigo - that then left me feeling sick and slightly dizzy. I was careful with my movements for about 2 weeks. This time, it wasn't fading. I tried to get in with my doctor for help. It took forever to get in. By now, panic is starting to set in. I was trying the half somersault, and tried to figure out the epley maneuver (which I quickly found provoked the symptoms and totally freaked me out). I finally see a different doc, who helped expedite an appointment with the neurologist AND got me in to physical therapy to see a Vestibular Specialist. THIS therapist is basically what saved my sanity. She is up to date on the latest vertigo studies and has actually had it herself (which is a blessing - as she really gets it) My therapist put these special goggles on me to watch and record my eyes. She did 6 different tests - all of them designed to test each of the different inner ear canals. She found I had left sided posterior positional vertigo due to the way my eyes twitched. She did the Epley maneuver twice on me. Both times vertigo was provoked upon initially laying me down (Dix Hallpike), and upon the final maneuver of me sitting back up. And yes, it was horrible. She said I was cured and to go home and start doing normal things again. Another thing to mention - is that I had already had vertigo for so long, that I developed other vestibular problems, such as gaze stability. My dizziness moved from being positional, to also getting waves of dizziness when I'd just be sitting still trying to watch TV. So she gave me exercises to strengthen my vestibular system. I still felt crappy. I went back a week later. Dix Hallpike was positive again, so she did two more Epley maneuvers and sent me home again. I continued exercises. This went on for 6 weeks. At one point, my anxiety was through the roof. There was not ONE thing I could do to escape the dizziness. It was there when I moved. It was there when I was still. I started to feel nauseous ALL the time. I cried and said I couldn't go on living like this. It is truly life changing. My therapist talked me off the ledge every single week. She is amazing - and she knows the feeling. She also told me to quit taking the Meclizine as it really doesn't help. In total, I did the Epley 20 times and it sucked EVERY SINGLE TIME! I was allowed to do it at home, as I had the movements down pat. I also tried the half somersault as well, as that didn't provoke the vertigo. After 3 miserable months, I went in and the Dix Hallpike didn't provoke the vertigo. I told her I still felt really funky though. She said that my system is now trying to reset - as I had been off balance for SO long, my vestibular system is all messed up. I continued to feel hopeful, but still felt queasy and dizzy - but a different dizziness. I saw the therapist a week after that and told her I thought the negative Dix Hallpike was a fluke. She laid me back again and it was negative. She tested all 6 ear canals. Still negative. Through all of this, she felt it was SUPER important that I continue to move my head as much as possible. She said it's 'old news' to keep your head upright for 24 to 48 hours after the repositioning exercises. Three weeks later I am still experiencing mild dizziness. An interesting thing to note is that I was able to continue running through all this. She was amazed that I could knock out a 12 mile run, and even hit the trails and run on technical ground with hills and rocks, snow and ice and such. The week that the crystal finally went away - I also did some serious hard and fast snowmobiling. Sadly - I can't tell which Epley maneuver was 'the one' that fixed me. Or was it the snowmobiling that jostled something? I never felt immediate relief. Most people don't understand (including the neurologist I saw that said I was healthy as a horse) that there is the VERTIGO (what you experience for 30ish seconds initially or during the Dix Hallpike) that I call violent. And then just regular dizziness. And then the residual dizziness after the BPPV vertigo is finally gone. And no one knows how horrible it is, and how it causes depression and anxiety, as you can't excape it. It's truly life changing. Sorry this is so long. I was so glad to find this subreddit! You can google BPPV all day long, but you only get statistics. It has helped SO much to hear other people's stories and know there are others out there that can relate. And for me, now dealing with the residual dizziness is what's scary. But I've been reassured after finding this forum, that it's common and normal. I have so much more to my story - but tried to abbreviate it. For what it's worth - I'm a 50 year old female and super healthy, active and fit. I run, ride horse, snowmobile, trap shoot and show my dog in agility. I've never had any super harsh head injuries or major illnesses. And I hope like HECK this never comes back again - even though I know it will. But at least I have 'tools' now to try to fix it right away, so it doesn't turn into the monster it did. To those struggling, hang in there! And see a vestibular therapist or go to a dizzy clinic ASAP to get help and reassurance!!!!!",

        "content": "    I have smoked pot since I was 12 years old, so I guess it has been 39 years now. That blows me away. I have had times of less use, but over the last 2-3 years my use really ramped up. I found that the more I used, the less high I got due to a higher tolerance. I decided it just isn't fun anymore and decided to quit. I have tried unsuccessfully to quit in the past, like many out there I'm sure. I read a book called The Easy Way by Allen Carr and it really has changed my whole perspective. The key to quitting marijuana is the understanding that my conscious and unconscious mind have had it all wrong on previous quitting attempts. I always saw it as a huge loss on my part, that I was giving up something truly great. That marijuana is a benefit or crutch. That caused me to suffer through using the willpower method, and made me really jealous of those that could still use. After a period of abstinence, I would start feeling good, then talk myself into having just a little bit again, because I had been good and really showed myself that I was in control. That lead me right back to where I was in the first place. Not only that, it shattered my self confidence because I had sworn it off only to give in again. This lead to me concluding that quitting was basically impossible. The Easy Way teaches you that there is absolutely no benefit to using, and systematically debunks all of the false notions about the supposed good things that marijuana does. In reality, it is just another addictive substance, and the only thing it does for me (other than ruining my health and relationships) is overcome my short term withdrawal symptoms. I falsely believed that each time I took that next bong hit I was getting high, and really helping me to unwind and enjoy life, when in reality I was just getting back to feeling somewhat ok after the nervous tension of withdrawal symptoms. Over and over and over again. So it is day 6 now with this new method, and I do feel withdrawal symptoms (basically I can't sleep), but I do not feel like I am missing out at all. I am looking forward to having a clearer head and moving on from this addiction to a better life.",

I am looking for a team of people to potentially Co-Own this project with me for Rev Share. The Idea is still in early works, So i will be setting up a Trello Board where we can all bounce Ideas off eachother and hopefully create a Prototype or V0.1 before we look onto the bigger picture. THE IDEA: My Idea is an Online Browser based strategy MMO, Turn based. Were users will buy there Characters with Bitcoins, there will be Various packages available, From Peasant (Which is the smallest package, costing about $0.10 and can be obtained by watching ads), Warrior, Farmer and Nobleman. More to come. Once you have bought your Character, half of your purchase will go into the game as Money that can be found, looted, farmed etc and the other half you will have on you. You will be spawned in a random location, and forced to survive, build skills, farm and remain healthy. PVP Combat is available and you can attack anyone. Once you are dead, your character is gone and the money you have will be transferred over to the player that killed you. Now at any point in the game, you have had enough or wish to withdraw your winnings, you can withdraw your Bitcoins and potentially make a profit. I have BIG Ideas for the future, become rulers of lands, become mercenaries, sell information, Become a spy, Create Alliances, Wage war, Become a trader... ETC... opportunities become endless. CONCEPT : Turn Based, Each turn will be 1 Hour, You have Action Points that you can use, on anything : Move a tile, Farm, Train, Read, Negotiate, ETC.... Endless opportunities. Again this is long term goals for the future, i have a very basic Prototype agenda that I have written up. WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR : Developers (skills in PHP, SQL, HTML), Web Designer, Marketer, Artist, Music Writer, PEOPLE WITH IDEAS (I love to hear your thoughts and Ideas, everything is valuable to me! Come aboard ) Bitcoin Specialist Looking forward to hearing from you Thanks",

        "content": "    I have depression. First, it was postpartum. Now my doctor says it's bipolar depression. I don't know what it is, just that it affects me. Medication is going well, I feel pretty normal. My problem, however, is that I can't do what I used to enjoy, which is playing computer games. I was a huge world of Warcraft nerd for about 7 years. Over the past year I've completely dropped it, because I can't focus on it anymore. Or any game, for that matter. I download games I know I'll enjoy. I get psyched up to play them, eager to do nothing but sit at my desk and play. But when that moment happens and the game loads up and I hit start... all that build up just disappears. Poof. Gone. It's almost the opposite of interest. I immediately shut the game down and wonder what's wrong with me. Why can't I focus and enjoy the game? The same thing is happening for reading. Where I could spend hours upon hours in one sitting reading a book, now I can barely get a paragraph in before I put it down, disgusted with myself for being unable to invest in a past time I know I can and should be enjoying. Everything else seems fine. I can watch tv, talk with people and enjoy doing those things. I don't *feel* depressed right now, my medication is working very well. But it's like those two things are just... Gone. I look forward to them eagerly, but when it comes time its like my brain just repels them. Is this a symptom I'm not aware of? Or have I just... moved on?",

So naturally, when the weekend rolled around I asked a friend to come over and we played (more like learned) the game. We decided that it would be a good idea to record the time it took us to play. Our first game took us 4:23. By the time we were finished playing both of us were extremely exhausted and did not want to play again until the next week, but in the middle of the night I received a message from my friend telling me that he was hungry for more... since then we have played the game four more times decreasing each by almost an hour (with the exception of the last two which stayed at the same time of 2:10. During the time between the games, we have begun to think about asking some other friends over and attempting to make a 2v2 championship bracket thing.  #8203; Hey so I am completely new to Reddit and Boardgames of this caliber, so if there is anyone who is willing to help guide me in this ocean of information please help me!

When does full time nitec or higher nitec courses start? I see on the website that there is a Jan and April training timetable and I'm a little confused. Can I choose when I want to start the course or is it already dictated? How does the application process work exactly? If let's say I want to start in April, do I get to choose or is it that all full time courses start in Jan?",

We said yes and we had a blast. After about 2 hours, I got a text from my mom that said to come home I said bye to everyone when the EK came up and took the phone out of my hands. I snatched It back from him and he started to cry. The EM came over and asked him what was wrong. EK said \"That boy took my toy I found!\" The phone I had was an I Pod touch, so it was pretty small. The EM Says in a calm voice \"Please give back my sons toy\" So I told her it was my own thing and that he took it out of my hands. She then proceeds to scream \"IT WAS MY SONS! GIVE IT BACK OR I WILL CALL THE POLICE ON YOU!\" My friends started to back me up, saying that it was in fact mine. I texted my parents the whole thing when my friends were defending me.

        "content": "    You'll have a great time. Simply put, DisneySea just might be the crown jewel of Disney Parks! Tokyo Disneyland has a similar footprint to Magic Kingdom (before Fantasyland expansion) but is in some sense a hybrid of the US parks (for example PoC is better than Magic Kingdom but not as long as Disneyland) with several attractions not found elsewhere. Winnie the Pooh at Tokyo Disneyland is not to be missed. Keep in mind that these Parks are not operated by Disney, they they are fully licensed and contract services from Disney Imagineering. While you will certainly find your way without speaking Japanese most of the ride dialog is in Japanese. Food is also very Japanese. I should also note that both of these parks get very crowded! Use Fast Pass as much as you can (original paper system). These parks also have a [lottery](http://tdrexplorer.com/how-to-use-the-lottery-system-at-tokyo-disney-resort/) for many of the shows which might also save you time. If you are accustomed to the Park Hopper options of American Disney Parks things work different in Japan. While you can purchase multi park tickets they do not allow you to go back and forth between the parks on the same day and require yo to picket your parks when purchasing your ticket. 3 and 4 day tickets allow Park Hopping between parks on days 3-4. My wife and I spent 3 days at Tokyo Disneyland and Sea last Oct. and really enjoyed it. We have have been WDW Passholders for many years and felt the experience was awesome. Nothing \"poor mans\" about it. We stayed at the Tokyo Disney Hilton which is short walk from the Disney Monorail (not free). PM me with any questions.",

It's been a lot of fun and testers are enjoying it, but from the limited tests I've noticed a possible issue. While a dominant deck hasn't been established, it seems that the victor in each matchup is quickly determined with little variance, creating a sort of rock-paper-scissors dynamic. I know that this is an important part of a healthy game, but I'm looking for ways outside of card design to lessen it a tad. Any ideas?",

        "content": "    Number one: no more lying, directly or by omission. My gambling counselor reminded me that \"addiction thrives in secrecy\" when I explained that although I will lie occasionally, when desperate, I have typically gambled in the times I have had unaccounted for time. Getting let out from work early, finished gym and errands but still have time to be out, etc. When I lived alone for 1.5 years between having a roommate and moving in with my bf was the worst of it. The number two reason: I'm excited to budget. I have always loved learning about personal finance and I enjoy following things like debt free Instagram accounts. I even enjoy the challenge of making a good budget and sticking to it. But... When gambling... I know there is close to no point in making one, because the irrational thoughts always win. Plus what is the point of budgeting $50 for, say, gas money, when I am going to lose 100 gambling? It just feels stupid. Number three: the time. I just don't want to find time for this any more. I want to focus on the things that will truly make me happy. Number four: clear mind. I quit before and I need to get back where I was. Currently just hit rock bottom and have been feeling truly terrible. Today I'm hoping to make some plans to get back on track financially (for the short term) so I can get at the long term goal of crawling out of debt. Thanks for reading. 30 year old female in Canada. First of what will probably be a few posts over the next few months. Thanks also to the many of you who have inspired me on this sub when I was still just a lurker.",

A FINAL BOSS GRANDMA CANDY CORN APPEARED. It was a bit smaller than the others, and had white hair, glasses, and even rode on a small brown horse. I somehow knew that this one could NOT be defeated, so I just sat there. The horse neighed loudly, and proceeded to trample me to the ground and... THROW UP ON MY FACE.

        "content": "    So yesterday afternoon, around 5:30, I fire up D3 and did my usual 'Butcher run', which to me is essentially a planned route of elite farming, finishing with the Butcher. My route is pretty standard from alot of reccommendations I have read: Highlands: look for Watchtower. Festering Woods. Leoric's Manor. Graveyard. Halls of Agony 2. Warden. Watchtower. Butcher. This usually nets me a good 20+ elites. Sometimes less I'f I'm unlucky, but other times it will be much higher as well. Now, what I truly, TRULY cannot fathom, is how any class can do this whole run, in, and I quote, 'About 30 minutes'. 30 minutes. SERIOUSLY!? From start to finish, as a WD with almost 30k DPS, this whole run, including cleaning out my inventory, takes me 1.5 hours. I finished my route just after 7pm. That's quite a siginificant difference. I'm about to try ignoring blues and only picking up yellows as that can reduce town visits, but still, 30 minutes is insanely, INSANELY quick. Either DH and Wizard are ridiculously overpowered, or people are not actually timing how long it takes. 1.5 hours can 'feel' like 30 minutes. Am I doing something wrong? I generally explore the entire dungeon hunting for the elites, killing everything in my path. I dont have +movement speed on my boots or bracers thanks to the hilarious prices morons put on the AH (50 million? Really? ***king idiots.), but I dont see how much difference that can really make. So apparently, wizards and DHs are doing 3 runs for every 1 run of mine? Come on. This cant be right. ...can it? [Edit] Last night I did think it would go quicker if I just grabbed the yellows that dropped from mobs and ignored blues, cuts down the time back at towm salvaging everything and stashing it. Maybe 10 minutes saved there already.",

But can I pay the cost using a Canadian credit card? If I can pay with a Canadian credit card, would I have to pay the bill in USD for the boosted board? I also have to pay $85.00 for shipping, and I was wondering if it will get damaged during shipping.I also don't want to buy it from longboard living because the price is much higher. So is anyone reading this comment ever bought a boosted board from boostedboards.com and got it delivered to Canada with no damage on the board? By the way, I live in Ontario. Thanks for any feedback. Have a great day!",

Content is actually something I feel that the devs I talk to are really good at! Forget the studios that churn out cheap crap -- I think a culture is emerging where indies want to one-up each other on creativity and polish. 3. \"Indie\" to me means a small studio that can use the word \"fucktardbutthead\" in a game's title if they want, or create a game mechanic about sorting dogs by smell without worrying about getting fired.

Instead, they are much more nurturing, laid back and willing to let people walk over them and get in their way. A statistic to back this up would be the inmate ratio. Its around 85% male in the US - women are simply the nicer species. They do not wish to harm, they do not wish to compete or further themselves in comparison to the male. Males have shorter tempers, and often fight amongst one in another whereas a female will shrug it off and not take notice, being much more accepting. I think this may be linked to tester-one, but Im not really sure. Perhaps the history of women being the nurturing figure has also affected it. TLDR: Women are the nicer, more mature, passive gender.",

Thats what I did. Not only that you can send money via PayPal and other methods where you can link up credit cards. You know where the story goes. I won a lot of money at first and then lost even more. Way more. PayPal extended me credit so I used that up along with my other 5 credit cards and two personal loans. All maxed. Added up along with loans from family im looking at around $40,000 in debt. This has been hovering over me for a year now and I cant take it anymore. I keep depositing and the debt kept growing and growing. The apps are fucking rigged and are not realistic in the slightest but I still deposit and continue to lose. I quit my job. I have no income. Im gonna file bankruptcy. That will be a relief. Im gonna start over. Its like a bad dream that never ended. Well Im finally at bottom and need to stop the insanity and move forward. Its freaking crazy to think about how devastating online poker has become for me. I never thought I would lose anywhere close to $10,000 much less $40,000 on my fucking phone. Its a sickness and theres no future with this behavior bc like I said it doesnt even matter if you are good and get your money in good the app rewards morons and bad play so the money just circulates. If I had been playing live this whole time I bet I would be up $40,000. Disgraceful. What a disaster. Now my fiancs are fucked for the foreseeable future and this will set me back a decade.

        "content": "    Hello. We are Nevada residents, but in the next couple months we need to cross the border at Vancouver so we can return to Alaska permanently. We're Looking for some creative LEGAL options to cross the border in Vancouver and drive through BC into AK. We can't fly unfortunately. We would camp along the way, following all local requirements related to COVID of course. Currently the border is closed except to essential travel until 21 June. That would be fine, but the closure has already been extended twice, and I'm not confident it will open. According to CBSA, this travel would not be considered essential. I do have a family member who is an AK resident who is willing to pick up the van in Seattle and drive it the rest of the way, then my family could fly. I called the border and he would be allowed to drive through since he's an AK resident, provided he proves his residency, and also has a notarized letter giving him permission to drive my van. This is a little complicated, and flying is risky these days. The option I'm leaning towards right now would be to use the AK Marine Highway system, but I just wanted to see if there was a better way since it's a little pricey, and COVID and the political climate in the US is presenting some uncertainty these days.

        "content": "    Hi Im new to reddit but I was reading some stories on here as a dose of medicine during some free time.. so I wanted to share my story Ive been in recovery for over 6 years, with a couple relapses, my first meeting was when I was 18 (28 now) They say that gambling addiction is a progressive disease, and in my experience that is a true statement. So at 18 to 22, I was getting paid my wage and within days it would be gone, using payday loans to further gamble/ get me by, as I had next to no financial commitments, I justified that it was ok. I went to meetings for a couple months then decided that I knew better/cured as I hadnt gambled for a little while. BOY was I wrong, it was 4 years of hell, being in denial, gambling excessively, taking out more payday loans, (25 over 2 years), big bank loan, credit card, again wages. I remember having to put on a face that everything was ok with me, even though inside I was hurting, confused, as to why I hadnt had my big break yet... convincing myself that one day Ill win loads of money and be happy, that everyone will love me more because of having loads of money. The book described this dream world that I once believed in... Then that day came, one night of gambling online, roulette was my vice, I had a winning streak. I won more than I ever thought possible, I stopped myself and pulled the plug from the laptop and told myself FINALLY, finally I can stop gambling. A few minutes passed.. and I was itching to win more money and keep going, so I plugged my laptop back in, reversed the withdrawal requests for what I had won. And went on a losing streak, I lost 3/4 of it in a few hours and felt physically sick, as it would of got me out of debt and some left over, I didnt sleep for two whole days as my mind was working overtime as to what the hell I had just done... heart feeling like it was beating out of my chest. Somehow I withdraw the remaining (1/4) money. Within a week it was all gone, gambled in desperation to chase my loses. The problem is, with more money, my bets just got bigger... so I now believe no matter how much I could win, it will only go back, plus more. So whats the point? Youd think just knowing that on its own is enough to stop .. But that isnt enough for an addict like me, I go to two meetings a week to remind myself of what I was like How many times did I gamble until my last  pound was gone, then do the exact same thing the following month, after month... If anyone is interested to know more than I shall share more of my story ",

        "title": "    Entitled Bastards milk being crime victims",
        "content": "    This is about two entitled bastard former friends of mine, I'll call them EB1 and EB2. TL:DR version: four of my friends were victims of armed robbery. Two of them decided to use what happened in order for their own personal benefit, no matter who else they hurt on the way. My friends, EB1, EB2, M, and T are all single guy geeks with a lot of disposable income that they pour into electronics - big screen TVs, game consoles, high end computers, etc. They moved into a four bedroom apartment in a decidedly dicey high-crime area. Around 6AM, armed robbers, pretending to be security, break into their place, and, in the course of things, T and M get shot defending EB1 and EB2. M and T are taken to the hospital. EB1 and EB2 are not too keen on staying in the apartment that night, which, seeing as their friends' blood is all over the walls and carpet, is completely understandable. After checking w/management and Section 8, my husband and I invite them to stay with us in our small two bedroom apartment for a few days while their place is cleaned up. I expected a little bit of strangeness, because, holy shit, they woke up to guns in their face and ended up having to staunch their friends' gunshot wounds 10 minutes later. We were not expecting the following, and this is only a small sampling of the next two weeks of bullshit: -EB1 told the owner of a local military surplus store about the shooting, hoping to get a FREE GUN. Is pissed when this doesn't fucking work. -EB2 tells his work that he's too traumatized to come in. They are sympathetic, tell him, \"Well, you've saved up a lot of time off, take what you need.\" He bitches that they should have given him PTO instead of making him use vacation time. -when EB2 runs out of vacation time, he sets up a mental health care appointment, admits later he exaggerated and lied about symptoms for maximum points, uses the resulting PTSD diagnosis it to get another 3 MONTHS off of work. BTW, he was supposed to go back for therapy, which his insurance would have covered fully, never went. -EB1 can't be arsed to actually go to speak to a counselor, but lies and says he's got an official diagnosis, too. -EB1 and EB2 played movies and video games, with lots of gunfire and explosions, at top volume at all hours of the day and night, frequently at the same time and in the same room, which shared a wall with our bedroom. They stared at us like brain-damaged cows when we asked them to turn it down and use headphones at night. -very obese EB2 complains constantly about the couch bed he's using, tries to guilt my husband and I into giving him our bed. -Ate large quantities of our food (both were extremely obese), complained about our selection, never offered to help cook. We're on a fixed income and SNAP meant for two adults, not four. Got pissy when we suggested politely they use their own SNAP benefits to either pitch in or get their own food -Started to get their own food. Which was all prepackaged snacks and soda. They still ate our food, too. -All that prepackaged food and soda? Instead of throwing away wrappers and cans, you know, like normal people, they'd hide it. We were finding trash stuffed in couch cushions and under/behind furniture for WEEKS after they left. -EB1 complained when my husband asked him ONCE to help dry dishes. -We were apparently supposed to spend all our time with them, even if they were playing on computers and watching TV. If we wanted to do things by ourselves in the back part of the apartment, they'd wander over and bug us, literally not understand us when we said we wanted a little time to ourselves. They were REALLY bad about this with my husband, who was trying to make a go at it as a freelance programmer. -They had not fully moved out of their old place when the shooting happened. They hadn't moved a washer and dryer we were letting them BORROW. Months later, they admitted they never bothered to go back to the place or call the old landlord to make arrangements to get their stuff. They were mystified why we were furious, after all, \"you weren't using them!\" -While a certain amount of paranoia after what went down is understandable, one of them was walking to and from the mailbox BRANDISHING A NAKED KATANA. We were living in a state where any blade over three inches in public was illegal. Guy confidently stated the police wouldn't do anything because of what happened to them. After two weeks of this, we were on our last nerve. When one of them mentioned their grandfather was mailing them a shotgun, I realized there was no way in hell I wanted either one of these chucklefucks to have a loaded firearm in my place, positive someone or something would end up accidentally full of buckshot, and politely but firmly told them it was time to move back into to their by now long ago cleaned up apartment. Cue bitching. Now, our two friends, M and T, who were shot were going through hell at this time. Both ended up with permanent disabilities. Crime victim fund should have, but never did, pay for counseling. The police, based on absolutely no evidence, decided my friends were addicts and thieves themselves, they'd pissed off the robbers, so it was their fault, and did nothing. For really obvious reasons, M and T could not bring themselves to move back in. The managers understood completely, and let them out of the lease with no penalty. EB1 and EB2, however, said they were going to stay, but they were going to move into one of the two bedroom units. They wanted to move into our building, and we were dreading it, Turned out not to be an issue because not only did they never bother to actually get on the waiting list for a two bedroom, THEY NEVER PAID RENT AGAIN. They just stayed in their apartment playing video games and watching movies. When the managers asked for rent, they trotted out the \"but we're traumatized\" line. EB1 never had a job in the first place, and wouldn't look for one. EB2, as previously mentioned, wangled his PTSD diagnosis into a months-long vacation from work before. He had a substantial amount in savings, enough to have kept both him and EB1 afloat until a two bedroom opened up, but didn't do this. After about three months of this, the apartment finally told them they'd have to leave so they could put someone in who could pay. EB1 and EB2 immediately complained to us about how unfair it was - they didn't make M and T pay, why should they have to pay? Maybe because you were STILL ON THE LEASE? They dragged their feet on this, too. Now, M and T had been moving their stuff out gradually, b/c they were working/had medical appointments, plus they had to get someone with a truck to get the big stuff. EB1 and EB2 had told them there was no rush, seeing as they were still there, take all the time they needed. T got all his stuff out, M had most of his small stuff, just needed to get heavy furniture (he'd furnished nearly the entire apartment with stuff he'd been slowly accumulating over the years) out. The complex, understandably pissed that they'd been taken for, by that point about THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS told EB1 and EB2 were told they had a month's notice to vacate or the complex would start eviction proceedings. They made ABSOLUTELY NO PLANS to move and find a new place to live, or pay back rent or anything. EB1 still didn't have a job, EB2 still hadn't gone back to work. Two weeks before the month was over, I think it finally dawned on them they'd used up everyone's sympathy and could no longer play the \"traumatized\" card anymore. EB1, after not-so-subtly hinting he could move in with us, and we not-so-subtly said no way in fucking hell, after HIS OWN DAD point-blank refused to let him move in, frantically called his grandparents who lived on the other side of the country, made it sound like the evil apartment managers were being greedy and were going to put him out on the street and he needed a place to live and a plane ticket RIGHT AWAY. EB2 just told his parents he was moving back in. They didn't tell M, who was still spending a lot of time at medical appointments trying to get back the use of his right arm (he never did), they were moving out and that he had a very short deadline to get the rest of his stuff moved out. We didn't know they didn't tell him, or we would have. He found out two weeks after they'd split. We found out from friends who worked for the complex that EB1 and EB2 had left the apartment in an absolutely DISGUSTING condition. Remember how I mentioned they just hid their trash when they stayed with us? They'd done that FOR THREE MONTHS. They had access to a Dumpster. They just...didn't take the trash out, just let bags and bags pile up in a back bedroom, probably so when we came over, we wouldn't see it. And they left some other horrifying shit behind. Hentai. Furry porn. One left his FLESHLIGHT and LUBE behind, inexplicably leaving the lube in a huge puddle on the carpet. We were TOTALLY humiliated, because we'd been the ones to recommend the apartment and vouched for them with management. Of course the apartment came after them for the THOUSANDS of dollars of unpaid rent, as well as the TWO THOUSAND dollars it took to clean up the place to get it rentable again. Of course EB1 had split the state, but a collection agency came after EB2 - who lied and said M and T had been still on lease and were responsible for part of the bill. M and T had to threaten the collection agency with a lawsuit in order to get them to stop harassing them. (We didn't tell M and T the full magnitude of the fuckuppery until well after everything went down. They were thoroughly pissed.) EB2 stopped talking to us for about two years when we asked him to compensate us in some way for the washer and dryer he'd left behind in his old apartment. Years later, he reestablished contact, admitted he'd been a complete and utter asshole during that time, and asked for our forgiveness, which we gave him. We're friends again. EB1, on the other hand...he lived off his grandparents for a few months, until his grandmother died and his grandfather got sent to a nursing home. He then went to psychiatric services in the city he was living in and used the fact that he was a furry in order to fake being mentally ill (he didn't mention it was a kink of his, he pretended it was hallucinations), in order to draw disability and got a medical marijuana card so he could move in with a stoner uncle and pay rent in weed. He didn't get any ACTUAL psychiatric care, mind you, probably because they'd have told him to take a little fucking responsibility. We stopped talking to him after he said some truly bigoted shit to us about our religion, then claimed \"otherkin oppression\" when he called him out on it. Yeah. While recovering, T fell in love with M's sister. They're married and have two kids now. M was able to get vocational rehabilitation funding to pay for adaptive equipment and get a degree in web design. I want to make one thing clear. I know PTSD is real. I've struggled with it myself. All four of them went through a truly traumatic experience. M and T struggled through it facing the odds and came out on the other side. EB1 and EB2 used what happened in order to get freebies and sympathy, then ran out when the bills came due.",

        "title": "    My Story.",
        "content": "    I just thought I would tell my story of drinking and how I got and stay sober. As a child I was not well. This meant frequently being hospitalised at 2.00 or 3.00 AM. My father was an alcoholic who by my mother and Christian standards had limitations put on his drinking to some extent. This along with my father being away most of the day 6 days a week led to me being very insecure and feeling rejected. Then for around 12 years I was sexuly interfeard with by older men. This led latter in life to my believing I was bisexual and caused many problems to come. Among other thing I faced court charges over results of efects of this. At 14 years of age we moved to another town. I was taken from a school of 300 children to 1200 children. I was lost for the last two years of school just passing 5 subjects and failing 1. At 16 I had to leave home and move in with family friends I had not met. Soon after I was moved to a boarding house of grown men where I again was lost. I was bullied at work by 2 superiors. By now I was a very fragile and confused young man hardly knowing what to do. I was then introduced to alcohol by men in the boarding house. I suffered a bad hang over and blacked out from my first drink. Soon after came the club scene and my addiction to gambling. I very quickly progressed from beer to spirits. This was to get more alcohol into myself and do it quicker. Some years down the track I ended on pure spirits drinking 2 or 3 bottles a night or more. I began missing days at work very early in my drinking. 5 years or so into my drinking I was transferred with my work to another town. With this came a resolve to stop drinking. I did not understand I went with me. The sober time was short lived and the men I worked with wondered what happened to the man who did not drink. 18 months latter I faced court on 20 charges of stealing and drink driving. I very narrowly escaped time in prison. I was then to move from NSW to Queensland with my brother and sister in law. I stayed sober for a short time. By now I had to drink daily and was almost unemployable. I would steal alcohol as I had no money and a huge gambling addiction. I was to be introduced to AA with some short periods of sobriety. After 18 months I moved to Brisbane with family friends. My drinking slowed for a short time. I then moved into my caravan. Now free my drinking and gambling continued. I had short periods where I worked. I would either be sacked or leave. I once again went to AA having short periods of sobriety. Eventually falling in love with a lady from Alanon. We were married 12 months latter when I had a lengthy period of sobriety. May be 12 months or a little more. 3 months I to the marriage I slowly built up to a big bender. Up to now I had always been a soak drinker. 2 days before Christmas of 1989 I began drinking at a Christmas party at work. Being in a black out I don't remember but believe I drank to the not so wee hours of the morning. I eventually made it home that day. I will never forget my wife's only words. \"What a lovely Christmas present \" That to date has been my last drink. I was given a sudden spiritual awakening as described in the big book of AA. I realised if I did not have the first drink I could not get drunk. I threw my self into AA becoming a regular at several meetings. I continued to go for several years. Finding only Drukalogs and no real recovery I slowly stopped going. 3 or 4 years ago I went back to AA on and off. 2 years ago after my wife's passing I threw myself back into AA more than ever doing as many as 7 meetings a day and not less than 5 or 6 a week. I was to have difficulty getting to meetings when I had no motor vehicle. I also had a difference of opinion with some one who drove me home. I walked out and have not been back. Now being semi retired I use forums such as this to help keep me sober. Now I do think AA is a good program and always will. Today my life is simple. I do 3 half days of voluntary work a week. I have recently comited to returning to my church. I live on my own in a small granny flat. Life could not be better. I am a great believer in 1 day at a time. That is it. 1 day at a time. In the last 6 months I lost my motor vehicle. Had to declare bank erupt. Lost my wife 2 years ago. In spite of at times wanting to and verbally saying I would drink. I am very gratefull I have not. Now if I ended up virtuous in the gutter and hopelessly drunk and have come through all this sober may I say one thing. You can to if you wish to. Today is 10516 days sober for me. 29 years in December. Please feel free to message me as this will ensure my sobriety. The person with the longest sobriety is the one who woke earliest today. Take care. Your Friend John.",

        "content": "    Hi, I'm new to Reddit and figured this would be the best place to get clarification on this issue. So basically I went on sick leave back in December of 2019 and received something like 14 weeks of benefits through EI. Once my EI benefits were exhausted I couldn't return to work because of COVID as I was choosing to self-isolate. I then applied for and received the CERB benefit which I've now depleted as well. My question is this, since I was on EI before CERB will I now be able to go back onto EI or will I have to apply for the CRB? How would I qualify for the CRB when I technically didn't initially lose my job due to COVID? I have something like 960 hours of work in 2019, and the only reason I didn't return to work after sick leave was because of COVID and quarantine. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys. Stay safe.",

EC3: Hunter or should I call you boss? When I was called up to the big time WWE I didn #8217;t have you introduce me as this next big thing. I don #8217;t even understand why was I called up when I was not even going to be featured. HHH: Its hard to even make it to the WWE and now you #8217;re getting a pay check by us, you should be proud of it. EC3: proud of it? I think you forgot boss, you guys came crawling to me and offered me a contract. HHH: EC3, I don #8217;t have the time to waste on you, you wanna prove yourself to me how about tonight you face...! EC3: How about tonight EC3 kicks  #8216;The Game #8217; Triple H #8217;s ass all over this arena? HHH: Hahaha, you better watch your mouth kid otherwise it won #8217;t take me more than 2 seconds to unemploy your ass! Your opponent will be Bobby Lashley -Commercial Break- Triple H is walking backstage and is stopped by Braun Strowman Braun: I want Baron Corbin and I want him tonight. HHH: Braun, you,re not medically cleared for tonight I can #8217;t risk you getting injured even more. Braun: I didn #8217;t ask you! I #8217;m Telling you. HHH: you wanna play that game? Fine. Tonight if you agree to a match with a stipulation, I #8217;ll make sure Baron Corbin gets in the ring with you. Braun: I accept HHH: seeing that last night you got put through 2 tables, tonight you #8217;ll face Corbin in a Tables match and if you lose, you can kiss your chance of competing at WrestleMania. The IC Champion Finn Balor comes out. Finn: 3 long years. I have waited for 3 long years to hold one of these. I was the first Universal Champion until I had to vacate the title due to injury. When I came back, I thought I #8217;d be thrusted into the Main Event scene on the get go, but due lack of support from the back I had to fight for myself and the Balor Club and now it #8217;s just  #8216;Too Sweet #8217;. Since, I know how hard it is to get this, I want to earn it. Therefore tonight, right here right now, the WWE IC championship is on the line for any one of those NXT newcomers. This is you chance to make your mark. If you feel confident enough, let #8217;s dance! Out comes Ricochet. Finn Balor V Ricochet. -Commercial Break- Winner- Finn Balor Backstage:- Charly: Ricochet was really impressive in his match, and speaking of impressive please welcome Dean Ambrose. Dean last week, you told Seth Rollins to slay the beast which was considered by many to be impressive after all you went through! Dean: Charly, this industry is built on respect. Who came and who went had always respect in their hearts. I don #8217;t see eye to eye with Seth but I do respect the man.. Respect... let me have this mic. Dean walks away and his music hits. Dean points at commentary table and gets in the ring. Dean: Respect. You respect the people you work with but one guy has been a big bully towards someone I know. I #8217;m talking about you, you tattooed neck freak, Corey Graves. You have been bullying my wife for far too long. If you have any question why don #8217;t you get in this ring and ask me face to face like a man.? Corey pleads with Renee to calm Dean down. Dean: Corey, I #8217;m only gonna count till 5 and if you don #8217;t get in here, well let #8217;s just say there #8217;s no wall stopping me from getting to you and dragging you by that hair of yours and stopping your face till you can #8217;t breathe. Dean reaches till 3.. and Kevin Owens #8217; music hits. KO: Dean, what #8217;s wrong with you!? That man is just doing his job and so is your wife. This whole Lunatic thing is really getting out of hand. Dean: Ladies and Gents please welcome back, Kevin Owens. I don #8217;t know why you came out here and I don #8217;t know why you choose to get in my business but.. KO: Dean, you #8217;re threatening my friend and I #8217;m not gonna sit in the back and watch you.. Dean: Friend? That freak is your friend. Makes sense both of you have a lot in common. Both of you are failures in the ring and both of you cheated on your wives. Dean Ambrose #8217;s music hits Dean: no, no, no, hit my friend #8217;s music. Let #8217;s welcome him back. Corey Graves leaves the announce desk for the rest of the show. Graphic- Braun Strowman V Baron Corbin is next -Commercial Break- Braun Strowman V Baron Corbin Winner-Braun Strowman Lucha House party comes out. Kalisto: Guys, we have been best friends before we even got to the WWE! We have trained together and been there for each other but guys I have to tell you something you don #8217;t know. Guys, I have found someone who loves me and she #8217;s just perfect. I have a girlfriend. WWE Universe please welcome... Alexa Bliss comes out. The B team comes out. Kalisto: why are you guys here? Did you guys also find your love? B-Team: no we #8217;re still virgins who #8217;re gonna kick your asses. Lucha House Party V B-Team Winner-Lucha House Party w/ Alexa Bliss B-team collect themselves in the ring. Bray Wyatt #8217;a buzz hits and Bray looks at B-team, smirks and hits sister Abigail on Bo Dallas while Curtis Axel watches.

I hope that was impressive Paul Heyman comes out and shakes hands with EC3 -Commercial Break- Paul cuts a promo hyping Brock V Seth. Seth Rollins interrupts. Seth:you wanna know what Burn it down really means? Seth hits Paul Heyman with a curb Stomp. Backstage- Natalya and Ronda Rousey are shown talking to each other. Nattie: Ronda, after last night are you sure you still want to put your title on the line? Ronda: I #8217;m not away from my family just to sit in the back or cut a promo. This is not only my job but it #8217;s something that I enjoy. I enjoy breaking people #8217;s arms. Had Becky not been a hot head and tried to act cool I #8217;d have enjoyed hanging her arm in my trophy case. So tonight I #8217;ll enjoy... Security: excuse me,Ronda they needs by the interview area. Ronda: sure. I #8217;ll see after the match Nattie. Ronda leaves and in walks Lacey Evans walks in. Lacey: Natalya, poor you and your family. Nattie:excuse me? Lacey: Just look at you. You #8217;re from the Hart Family they must be so proud, especially your late dad. He was nothing more than a sidekick and you are nothing more than Ronda #8217;s bitch.. Nattie hits Lacey and security separates them.

        "content": "    During the last 3 months, I worked my ass off to pay back $15k debt ( payday loans, credit cards etc) which I kept delaying for years and interest kept adding up. Working long hours and working out daily, still I felt bored daily, which triggered thoughts of my ex after 1 year and I could not sleep at night or work properly with her thoughts . I ended up making a $500 deposit from savings and turned it to $1200 off a few bets. I hate and still remember the person I was when I was addicted to gambling before I quit 3 months ago. - always paranoid, annoyed , jittery and not sleeping at all( betting 19-20 hrs a day, if not gambling, still checking odds of bets) I didn't withdraw and lost the bet going full swing on roulette from boredom. I'm happy that I lost because after 3 months being clean, those were the worst last few days gambling mentally. - didn't sleep more than 1-2 hours daily. - didn't eat more than 1 meal or an apple. - didn't go to the gym. - always jittery and annoyed/depressed whether I won or lost the bet. I don't like that person, so I closed my account and saying good bye to the person I described above. Most of you won't ever quit or pay back debt, unless you literally pay the credit card balance in portions/full or loans the moment your mind tells you to make a deposit for gambling. Use that money to pay back some of your debt instead. You will feel 100000x better than losing it gambling. That gambling money won will never be spent on you, but only going back to feed the addiction.",

Struggled with drugs and alcohol since I was a teen, turning 32 this year. Gambling has been a problem for a long time, but having made progress controlling my other additive tendencies, it now has my full attention. Lost tens of thousands of dollars over the past year. $900 today alone. Usually start with online poker then end up chasing losses at whatever table games the site offers. Narcotics Anonymous is a big part of my life, but I don't feel I am working a great program, not really working with a sponsor at all. I do attend several meetings a week. There is one GA meeting in my city I've thought about checking out. I feel so foolish, I continue to put the money on the sites, knowing full well I'm never going to see it again. It's not even the slightest bit enjoyable. I make good money, and have very few expenses or debt which is a huge positive. I am done with senselessly pissing money away for nothing. No more gut wrenching feelings after losing. Tomorrow is a new day, and I'm ready!",

I have been experiencing lots of issues lately with all my lains being super unbalanced. talking 0-5 in mid and bot by the 10 min mark. It seems really inconsistent with the matchmaking. I have been forced to duo abuse to win games just so i know i have 1 winning lain aside from my own. I'm rocking about an 85% WR with duo (over 40 games) but scratching by at about 53% solo. It seems pretty regular to have two+ auto filled on my team and theirs will be all main role. is there some weird matchmaking rule that if you duo when you go back to solo que you get matched differently? Also I know this comes down to the individual, but my team can never seem to grasp the concept of 1/3/1 or pressure for a split. its a Yorick mains nightmare to be trying to split with your whole team twittling their thumbs in jg near dragon w/ 2:43 sec left on spawn. You know the moment you step past river to ward or take a wave you get 1v4 ganked with your afk team flaming you. I often try to wait for the enemy majority to show on map to push but the moment i start there is nothing to commit them to lain so they come to me w/o loosing CS or towers or objectives. Don't get me wrong i know im not a perfect player, and i make several mistakes (my number 1 reason for dying is overstaying for 1 more turret plate). I would just really like to climb w/o relying on a buddy being online. How do you guys deal with brain dead teamates or with a team that doesn't understand the value of split pushing?",

In my past experience, people did not tend to pursue self-growth as intensely or as motivated as I have. I have a brand new friend who is comparable to Abdullah. This friend already manifested their life partner and did it using the same methods and I am doing now. I drove with this friend recently and every two or three minutes we would see a car with a license plate of 333, 444, 111, 777, 888. Yesterday this friend told me to try the lottery, which is something I would never do. In response, I told my friend that I #8217;ve been going to bed every night visualizing that I am looking at my bank app on my phone, and that I have $100,000 in my checking account, my insurance and two credit cards are completely paid off with a $0 balance. So when it feels right, I #8217;ll try the lottery out of my friend #8217;s suggestion. This friend and I basically have the same level of realization, where this entire  #8220;reality #8221; is simply a video game. It #8217;s freeing and empowering to have a friend that resonates on every Neville-Goddard related topic.",

        "content": "    Long time lurker, first post. I tend to be more of an observer than a participator, but I did want to share a little of my story. I never would have figured myself for a compulsive gambler. I grew up fairly poor, certainly knowing what it was like to do without but still getting by. In time, and with great difficulty, I got educated (BS, MS degrees). Even managed to find a six-figure job. I thought that was my great struggle in life, wresting myself from the clutches of poverty, and I got through it! I was now even pretty good at budgeting/saving money, and, after finishing my master's, here I am making $100,000/year. Not wildly rich, but certainly comfortable. Life is pretty good at this point. And then I found gambling. I had parents who gambled. Quite a bit, it turns out. I had even been with them to the casinos a time or two when I was a teen (going to the buffets). I thought the slot players looked like zombies. Fast-forward several years later, and I'm living in Houston, making occasional round trips on I-10 to visit family, when one day I decide to stop at a casino in western Louisiana. I had gambled a few times here and there, but this was...different. What began as a random break from driving home one day morphed into me giving every last free dollar I had to this place for the next few years. It's like watching a horror movie, starring me. Or a dream. A nightmare I could never wake up from. I had become one of the zombies I vividly remembered from childhood. Throughout that time, now still, I intimately understand why those people looked so catatonic. Every person I had known who was addicted to something, and every time I wondered why they couldn't just power up and walk away, now I knew. I've eaten that forbidden fruit too. Slots became my obsession. It's knowledge you don't want anymore but can't un-know. In truth, I'm not sure why I'm 180 days clean at this point. There is no catastrophic turning point, no one thing that prevented me from ever returning to the casinos. I left Houston. Thought that might help. But I moved to an area to which casinos were even closer. I started frequenting them. After years of chasing losses, countless threats of never returning, numerous day 1's, I silently resigned and promised to shift my life closer to something I want it to be. Maybe it was February. I went on a trip to run a half-marathon through some wilderness, something akin to a spiritual trip for me. On the way home, I stopped at a casino. My old casino. Lost the last $300 I had. Wasn't even upset. Just numb the rest of the trip home. Six-figure job and I didn't even have money to stop and grab a burger, and the austere beauty of the weekend trip, the soul-nourishing adventure from which I was returning, was already a dull memory. I was fully aware of the dichotomy of the trip. I'd like to say it was my last casino visit, that the awareness of how much gambling was really robbing me of was enough to shake me loose of its grasp, but I went twice more. I lost a total $20 the first trip, and $6 the second. Both trips ended because I couldn't stomach losing anymore. And that's it. Maybe it was an awakening. Hopefully my last trip ever, out with a whimper. And I'm absolutely okay with that. For all the times I've thought I would win back every last dollar I'd ever lost in one night, then flip the casino two birds Kenny Powers-style on my way out the door, for every time I've felt like something was owed to me and destiny was going to bring it to my doorstep in my casino swan song, reality is that it's not going to happen. And maybe I don't want it to happen. Maybe that leaves the door a little too open, makes it a little too easy to return. I haven't joined GA yet. I think I will soon. I've been too reclusive about this. And a little fortification can make you stronger. 180 days has surprisingly not been difficult (overall), but I'm still close enough to the fire to sweat. There are certainly days I have to allow the urges to wash over me and let them pass. Once I even got dressed to go, only to plop down on the couch and let the moment pass. For now, the stories people post here have been inspirational and familiar. It's amazing: All these feelings you think are unique, felt by only you, and then you read someone else's post and it reads like a biography. Here's what 180 days has felt like for me: I have seen my stress levels drop to a fraction of their former selves; I have told myself I hate myself much less; I have quit saying I hate my life and began to think that maybe it's not so bad; the two things I wanted to happen through gambling, debt reduction and savings increase, have both occurred in the absence of gambling. Amazing. I do struggle thinking about the money I've wasted, but I've gotten better about accepting that it's gone. I now try to view it as payment for an education, on an equal plane with the money I paid for college. I really do wish anyone struggling with this the very best. It's a mountain we're all climbing, looking for the downhill side. A sport that's easier with team support. My friends, family, they all know. It helps to be able to talk about it. Reading stories on here helps. Writing this post is a little cathartic. If you're trying to escape gambling's grasp, please keep climbing. Soon you'll be high enough it can't reach you.  TL;DR - Gambling sucks. Avoid it at all costs if possible.",

I spent a painful amount of time doing rerolls during this godfest, and I got a few so-so options to choose from and was hoping I could get a little bit more direct insight from some currently active players. I have... Amon, Apocalypse, Avalon Drake, Bearded Deity Guan Yu, Beast Rider Merlin, Blue Dragon Caller Sonia, Goddess of Power Kali, Liu Bei, Radious, Jester Wizard Chester, and Krishna. EDIT: Just to be clear, each of these monsters is on a DIFFERENT account - I just made backups of my game data whenever I got something 'good'. I might spend a *little* cash on this game (like 5 bucks a month or something) but I'm not gonna dump 200 dollars on it or anything. From what I've read, Blonia is only great with a full REM team, and Kali is hard to use even for experienced players. Krishna seems like a good choice, but something really strikes me about Chester - Most of the info I read said he's a pretty serviceable leader, and is ideal at the subset of dungeons that his active skill can clean up. Honestly I didn't want to really go with Avalon Drake just because I really like the blue/dark/fire guys a lot better... lol. But a couple guides said he was a good starter for non-IAP players. :/ Any insight that anyone could offer would be really appreciated, I'm very excited to get into this game. :D **EDIT: How's this for ironic? I just rerolled again, one last time, right after the godfest ended... and pulled Set! Thoughts on him??**",

        "content": "    Hello everybody, first time posting here, long time lurker. I wanted to share my story in hopes that even one person browsing this forum would gain something from it. I am 25, about to be 26 and have been a compulsive gambler for 10 years. I remember winning $300 the first time I ever gambled playing blackjack at a casino 2.5 hours from my house. I was 16 and the rush and high were incredible. The next day I drove back, alone, and lost my entire bank account in 30 minutes, then drove back home. 5 hours to lose everything. In the years following I began playing poker, betting sports daily, getting into some of the highest stakes games possible and doing it on marker (credit) with money I did not have. I lied, manipulated and did whatever I had to in order to have action. I always paid my debts, however I had to though. I sit here now posting this, 30k in debt + maxed out on my credit cards after being stiffed by someone I booked for 71k. I've been fked as a bettor and as a bookie, if you actually think you will make money in this business you're sadly mistaken. In addition to the money lost, the time lost spent with friends, family, etc is all lost by checking scores every second like I did or playing poker until the sunrise. Needless to say I was in a very dark place. Somewhere I don't wish my worst enemy to be. I didn't want to wake up, couldn't fall asleep, had no motivation to look for work. I was depressed, angry, hopeless. 19 days ago I decided to attend a G.A. meeting with the stereotypical mindset that those types of meetings get. My finance situation is still absolutely terrible, I'm in no better place than I was before walking through those doors in that sense, but I also am in NO WORSE place. Money is money, your values are what counts. Through the program I've been able to really self assess myself and realize that this is not something I want in my life, and it has given me HOPE that by being a better person, being honest with others but most importantly MYSELF, there is a way out. So my point is for all of those who feel hopeless, like things will never change, want to just give up on life like I did. You are not alone. You have time to fix things, but do it before it's too late. I see people walk in to their first meeting at 45, 55, 65 and I am grateful I realized I needed it at 25. There is no shame in going to G.A. There is pride. Pride in knowing you will become a better person. You will learn or relearn values you've always had. Accountability to yourself and to others is so important. I've had my reputation tarnished, lost close friends, and done just about everything wrong. But this post is not meant to serve as a recruitment mechanism, more so just to hopefully find it's way onto the screen of at least ONE person who can relate. We are all compulsive gamblers, we need to accept that and we need to support each other.  There is hope for the hopeless.",

I will make sure I will stay off from it but to recover I need some time. Every time I will think of just winning 100 I will start to think twice about it. Because I will go and hunt for more and fail miserably. I will keep my post alive each month and even if I gamble even an euro I will let it know by here. I would only lie to myself so I have to stay strong now. Edit: I felt very awful at first to even think about this. But I think I am starting to feel abit of relief that I told about it.",

        "title": "    Me [24 F] with my BF [24 M], having trouble dealing with his relationship with EX",
        "content": "    Okay, so. This has been an issue for about half a month.  #160; My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months. I got with him shortly after leaving my last relationship, which was about 7 years. I do not speak with my ex, because he was deeply hurt by me quickly being with someone else. It's really a whole other topic, what happened between us. Long story short - I was not in love with him anymore, he had numerous mental health issues that he refused to get help for (anger, breaking things, suicidal thoughts) and I was also not physically attracted to him. If I had the option, though, I would like to talk with him every now and then. Share things we were both interested in, tell him stories of people we both know that no one else would really understand. But it's not that way, and I've accepted that.  #160; My current BF got out of a relationship about a year ago, but continued contact/giving her rides/hanging out with his ex until she moved a state away about 6 months ago (so right when we started talking/getting serious). We currently live together, but we are not under any sort of leasing agreement. Which was the main reason why I was okay with moving in so quickly. If it didn't work out, one of us could just move out without any legal issue. Obviously, I was naive, because it does create more complications than that if we were to break up (see: sorting each others stuff, and moving which just sucks in general).  #160; Okay, on to the actual issue now that you guys kind of know the history.  #160; My boyfriend has always been in close contact with his ex, who he dated for 4 years. He told me it was strictly friendship. I got curious one day and read their messages. Most of it was normal stuff - the stuff he mentioned they spoke about.  #160; Then of course I found something I did NOT like reading at all. I'm going to break this up by saying what I read and what he explained it to mean after we spoke. He said to his ex:  gt;I miss you. I want you both.  gt; gt;He told me that meant: I miss seeing you as often as we used to. I want you differently than I want her. I want you in every way, and I want her as a friend.  #160; He said to his ex:  gt;I felt so passionately about you, it sucks losing that. I just feel like i'm not gonna feel like that ever again.  gt; gt;He told me: She cheated on me. I was referring to the fact that I was naive when we dated. That I thought everything was perfect, but now I have to be apprehensive.  #160; He said:  gt;It's weird to me, having feelings for multiple people.  gt; gt;He didn't explain this one..forgot to bring it up when I confronted him about what I found.  #160; So, as stated, after reading this stuff I told him I snooped and we talked. I was so upset I felt like I could throw up. It just didn't seem possible that this could happen because up until this point, I was full throttle in the honeymoon phase. He comforted me, told me I misunderstood his words, that she was nothing compared to me. His explanations are still shit in my opinion.  #160; I brought her up VERY often, trying to work with him, without outright saying they need to stop talking. Keep in mind they talk about 3-4 times a week through messenger. They do not call each other or see each other.  #160; He spoke with her about boundaries one day. This conversation was mostly just him saying  gt;\"hey I know we use these nicknames because we are used to it and it's no big deal to us, but I want to be respectful to my GF and not use them anymore. They can be perceived as petnames.\" She seemed miffed about it but said  gt;\"I thought we were closer, sorry, didn't mean to interfere\" and she changed the nicknames back to their regular names.  #160; A few days after that, I was not happy he didn't mention cutting down contact with her (which he agreed was a reasonable request). So he spoke with her again. This time going into more detail about how I did not like certain conversation topics they had had. How it would probably be a good idea to cut back. She got upset. She said things along the lines of  gt;\"This is just leading to us not talking at all.\" \"I'll just leave you be\" \"I thought we were closer than this\" \"I don't want to ruin your relationship. You know I don't want to get back with you, and you don't want to get back with me.\" \"I'm thinking of marrying my new boyfriend\" \"I would never try to ruin 2 happy relationships\"  #160; I can't remember exactly his responses, but I know he said,  gt;\"I don't want to lose you as a friend.\" \"GF(me) means a lot to me, I want her to trust me 100%\" \"I would like you two to meet\"  #160; Honestly...why does he want her in his life so badly? She cheated on him(did I mention this?). He has said they don't talk about things that are too interesting, just memes and cats. And some mutual video game interests. I understand losing a friend of many years BECAUSE I DID THE EXACT SAME THING WITH MY EX. Which makes me wonder if I'm being a hypocrite? I would like to talk to my ex, but I really doubt we would have conversations about our feelings or missing one another.  #160; I asked him why he thinks it's unreasonable for me to request he stop talking to her, and he said \"because she's important to me, and she is not a threat to us at all\".  #160; He has been very sweet to me our whole relationship, even through out all of this. He has never gotten mad or upset, even when I admitted to reading his messages. If I had never read those messages, I would still be on Cloud 9 with this guy. He treats me so well. He is intelligent, funny, and very attractive. And the sex is like nothing I've had before. He tells me I make him very happy, and that he loves me so much, etc, etc. It's all hard to believe when I know just 3 weeks ago he was telling his ex that he missed her (\"friendship\") and felt so passionately about her .  #160; Am I overreacting? I am having a very hard time moving past this bump in our relationship. It really really sucks to go from honeymoon to doubt. I want them to stop talking. After reading old messages between his ex and him when we first got together, she was having a very hard time accepting he was moving on (even though she had a bf of her own). She told him her fear of me telling him to stop talking to her. To me, this says she's not over him and is clinging to the idea of having him in her life, relationship or not.  #160; Should I be accepting his efforts of cutting down contact? Obviously no one can know his intentions. It really seems like he is trying to make it up to me by talking with her and letting her know his feelings for me.  #160; What are your relationships with your ex? Is this normal? --- **tl;dr**: Boyfriend continues contact with ex, even after I have made it clear it makes me uncomfortable after reading some questionable messages between the two.",

I've lost more than 13 kg and counting , and the problem persists. For something like 4 years I have a really, really, really annoying feeling in the joints. Over the knees, the fingers, my foot, at the end the end of my column / start of my bottom, sometimes even in my neck and my shoulders. It is NOT a pain. It's an uncomfortable feeling asking me to like stretch out these members. I stretch and its like nothing. I take medicine for muscle pain and it also does not solve the sensation. I have to stretch out all the time when I'm feeling this, and it keeps there. I remember it started from nothing, after a period of about 30 minutes of normally a walking exercise. I started doing pilates and that feeling didn't pass. I have the impression that it comes more often when I do exercises, but I 'm not sure. I'm feeling it now and I didn't do any physical effort.. It is a constant annoyance. Sometimes I go days without feeling anything , but then the feeling comes back.. What it can be and what can I do to relieve this? It is difficult even to sleep sometimes.",

        "title": "    Oh, but he didn't stop there.",
        "content": "    Long time lurker, first time poster. Both me and my partner work in IT of some kind, he's in a fairly high-level helpdesk type role (3rd line, project design and implementation) and I'm a product manager at a fairly small company so will regularly muck in with the helpdesk to get a mood level or if it's priority one/needs diplomacy. We'll often trade horror stories from our day while making dinner. This one is from a bit over a year back, when he was working in the IT department of a mid-sized company. It spans a couple of countries but each one tends to handle their own IT needs except where crossover is required. Sorry, it's a second hand story so it's pretty narrative. Consultant comes in to look over IT security policies in line with incoming GDPR regulations. Their findings were pretty good, not a lot of changes needed, but they recommended putting in a tighter timeout to lock machines after inactivity (company held a fair amount of customer data which falls under the personal category and not all departments were allowed to access). It gets set to five minutes - arguably annoying, but enough time to visit the bathroom or get a coffee without it locking. Call comes into the helpdesk, coworker picks up. It's a user in the category of \"known to us\", our shorthand for \"oh no, not you\". If memory serves, he's someone in marketing. User is asking if they can disable the lockout time on his account. Response is no, it's a global setting, they can't do it for one person. User gets to shouting about how this is the biggest injustice of all time and the coworker is terrible etc. There's a zero tolerance of abuse to IT in the company, at which point the helpdesk can just hang up. So he does. Partner heard everything and made a mental note Two minutes later, phone rings, my partner answers. The user is back, obviously trying his luck to see if he'll get a different response from someone else. But no, no different response. Partner goes on to say it's a GDPR thing and explains why it's good practice, in the hopes he'll understand. Ah, so naive. Same tirade, same end result of hanging up. At this point partner decides it's wise to give a heads up to the run team manager that this guy is likely going to call and complain. It happens literally while he's telling him. He dives immediately into shouting (and I think tries to persuade him to fire the helpdesk). Manager tells him the same thing, and adds on that the abuse being directed at his team will need reporting to user's manager. User swears and hangs up. Manager gives a heads up to user's manager (\"oh no, he's doing what now? I'll talk with him. Sorry.\") Oh, but he didn't stop there. Next day it's business as usual, until the head of IT walks in with a look of disbelief. User tried to escalate to him. (This guy is in charge of all IT and development in the country for this company, best estimate about twenty people.) Same story in terms of his attitude, same response given. Once everyone relays their own tales, they all have a laugh about it and carry on. Oh, but he didn't stop there. Later on in the day, head of IT comes back to update them. User walked straight into the office for the Director of Operations and tried to convince him in person that this was a huge injustice. A reminder at this point. It's a machine lockout. That can be got past by just entering your password again. That is all. Nothing more. Nothing less. The Director of Operations had zero context of any of the previous happenings and relayed to head of IT. Who I can imagine just laid his head on his desk, told him the story and said he would handle. User's manager told again at this point, who was livid. OH NO... BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE. All was quiet for about a week. No further complaints. Peace restored (at least as much is possible on the helpdesk). All of a sudden, run team manager starts absolutely wetting himself laughing. Gets off the phone and updates the team. The personal assistant to the owner of the company (by the way, based in another country - we've gone international, folks) emailed the head of IT, who relayed to run team manager. User sent a HAND-WRITTEN LETTER to the honest to god owner of the company to complain about the five minute timeout. Luckily, the PA screens all his physical mail. It was apparently filled with profanity and insults directed at basically everyone. Don't think user was fired, but honestly, I don't know how, and it's possible he's now gone. (Oh, and for the record, he did stop there.) TLDR: user escalates displeasure with machine lockout policy to owner of company with ~5k employees.",

Sure, depression makes you feel shite, I have been through it for years and I have spent many occasions lying in bed, crying and thinking things would never get better. My life feels better now and i'm not saying that I have a great life but i found pleasure in the simple things. Go take a stroll in a quiet area and take in the the nature, listen to the birds tweeting, breathe in that fresh air or you could go to a park and feed the ducks. Please think of something that you will achieve or enjoy in the short term and focus on that for now. Go and treat yourself to a Starbucks or sit and indulge in your favorite TV program whilst eating tubs of ice cream!

Ive been two months clean, but the last time I gambled I tried to commit suicide. Thankfully it failed and I was scared for life when I was sent to a mental institution. Long story short, first place to start is to admit you have a problem, you may say your done but when you truly put your foot down, youll feel the difference. When you see money in your account and those thoughts come again, youll win that battle instead of them, thats when you finally admit you got a problem and youre ready to defeat it. Its not an easy battle and sometimes itll take a traumatic lesson for you to get there but hopefully you wont have too. Second, try to remember what twenty and ten can lead two, thats what got me, a twenty wont hurt, its only a ten. Third, its hard because were adults and I know youre not asking them money to play, but when someone doesnt give you money after a lost, you truly have to sit back and realize what youre doing with your life. I had -300 dollars in my bank, I try to ask for anything to eat with and they denied me; I understood though. just imagine not having to pay anybody back or watching your account build because you fought dopamine. Those winnings never weigh more than your losses. With this virus, its helping me a lot and the real test will be when everything opens back up, but I know you got this. You hate casinos so much stop paying them, I hate people who made the machines i played on and I refused to watch my money go down a drain just to possibly win more than what i brought. Finally, apps. I Am Sober, I saw it up here and downloaded it, it remains you daily of goals you set. Its never an easy battle and youll always be an addict, but when you gain that control to stop those thoughts, youll be achiever.",

Personally, it died for me when I heard that Alex coorperated with a hentai game to add Ayano as a playable character there. As a response, I made a meme to make fun about it (using the drake yes and no meme template) and got instantly perma banned for it, no response from the mods. I have long given up the hope that Yandere Simulator is ever going to be finished or even playable and honestly I don't want YanSim to be ever successfull anymore. Because of that I am glad that somebody else who is seemingly much, much more competend (and also not creepy and possibly pedophilic like our Alex) took the wheel to make a good version of this game concept.

        "content": "    Hi, I #8217;m a 20 F with relatively good health. I #8217;m a size 14 and I #8217;m about 5 #8217;3 in height. Yes I #8217;m a Lil fat (due to depression) but not severely obese or anything. I don #8217;t get ill often maybe 3x a year but that #8217;s about it. I #8217;ve never had a serious condition, disorder before either. In the past I have been anaemic and I had a vitamin D deficiency and I was prescribed tablets for the year. I was meant to go back and get blood tests done to see if it had improved and to possible change my diet if it was a result of that. I do not take iron, vitamin D tablets anymore. I haven #8217;t for at least 2 years. I currently take birth control (rigvideon, sertraline). So around 5 days ago my throat hurt in the sense that it was like a dull pain, like someone punched my throat from the inside. It wasn #8217;t sore. It didn #8217;t sting. It just hurt. The pain was making the right side of my ear and head hurt and it was also making me feel nauseous. I managed to fall asleep and the next day my throat was fine. It was fine for a couple of days and I had no issue at all. On the third day all was good but on the night my throat began to feel weird. It felt like I had a lump inside of my throat, breathing felt super awkward and slightly distressing. It slowly began to get worse. My throat started to hurt but it did not feel sore, raw or sting. It just kind of hurt to breathe and it felt a little like I was choking when I tried to sleep (I sleep on my stomach). I managed to sleep and I woke up in the morning and I still felt the same. Anytime I started to walk fast the right side of my chest would hurt the back of my throat would hurt (not sore or sting). I went to see the nurse in the fourth day #8217;s morning as it still felt the same, laughing and doing anything such as walking fast or going up stairs super fast would make my throat and chest and back hurt. I told the nurse and she said that I had a respiratory virus and there was nothing she could do but I should drink plenty of fluids and take paracetamol. I have never had such a virus as I would remember how it felt but I have never felt anything like this which is why I #8217;m panicking a little. The only issue is I don #8217;t exactly trust the Nurses judgement as I have had bad experiences with her in the past. I went to her in the past (maybe a couple of years ago) about my periods they were heavy, painful and irregular. She prescribed me buscopan (I think I spelt it wrong) and ponstan. However during the whole appointment she barely looked at me, she didn #8217;t really ask any other questions and she just didn #8217;t seem to give a shit to be honest.They didn #8217;t do anything for me, when I went to another doctor they said that she should not have prescribed me buscopan. So that kind of put me off. It #8217;s now the fifth day and I #8217;m still feeling the same, I #8217;m not sure if this is how a respiratory virus feels like it also now hurts a lot if I lean forward it feels like my hearts gonna come out my throat. Again breathing feels really weird. My throat is not sore I do not have a cold or any other flu like symptoms and I haven #8217;t since it all began. And advice would be great. Thank you",

        "title": "    TIFU by being an edgy high schooler who loved to play HL2RP",
        "content": "    Hey, first post! This kinda stretched over like a few years and ended up about a sixish months ago. So, for those who don't know, HL2RP stands for Half life 2 Roleplay. For those who are confused, Half life 2 takes place after aliens called the Combine took over the world. It's a first person shooter, and everyone lives in like a 1984 dystopian society. (So let's make a roleplay where you can be an oppressed citizen, yay!) This started when I was a Freshman in high school. I'd play HL2RP for hours on end, ignoring my family, and investing time and these fake little characters who all ended up dead. My family HATED that game. I didn't do my chores, barely did my homework, barely slept. I was like constantly angry and depressed. It was terrible. Finally, sometime between the summer of Sophomore and Junior the server died. I went back to my normal self (Hurray!) Till about the end of Junior year, when I was bored and started playing again on a new community. From here, I worked my way up to admin, everyone hated the server's owner he was abusive (It's supposed to be an oppressed society yet he'd have rebel characters with massive armories of weapons and cloaking abilities.) and he'd ban anyone who disagreed with him. So he decided to let other players be 'owner' while he still technically owned the server. So me, and my real life best friend decided to be owners. Shortly after becoming an owner of this server, my best friend started to become an asshole. He'd say things \"You're not taking this seriously enough, you keep fucking around.\" and I realized, it's a video game. After all these years it finally dawned upon me, why am I getting so upset over a video game? So I was a chilled back owner, that being said I still enforced rules. I just didn't take people into private Teamspeak 3 channels to yell at them. People would constantly tell me I needed to step up. So I did.. The server was constantly having rebel issues. The rebels would go out and shoot the Combine, which in return would cause them to sweep the 'slums' and kill off people's characters. I had enough, so me and my government I formed decided to go kill all the fuckers who had excessive guns that they got through admin abuse to save the slums, on top of that, I had a Government faction, I wanted to rule the slums. Me and my squad of ragtagged soldiers started shooting at other rebels. A super admin runs into my channel and starts screaming at me through the headset. \"What the fuck? You are RDMING (random death match, aka killing without reason/Roleplay)\" I reply \"I'm not, I have a reason.\" \"No you don't, you need a reason! The rules say you need a reason!\" So I decided to remove the bit of the rules where it said you needed to reason. He proceeded to get even more angry. Yelling that he was going to report me. I said \"I'm owner, I made the rules!\" (Which I did.) That's the fuck up. My God, you ever seen a bunch of angry teenagers flip shit and scream for revolution on a video game forum? People were like \"Tyrannical Kitty is living up to his name!\" \"He needs to be removed!\" So I was. My friend who was a major ass about it who typed in all caps \"This behavior is FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.\" he was than removed from the actual owner about a week later(Remember when I said we weren't technically owners but we were?) and than the dude took over his throne of douchebaggery. He continued to be abusive (with no protest from the players) Till the community eventually died. I'm never playing half life 2 RP again. **TL;DR** I was a edgy kid who wasted his life on a video game. When I became owner I realized it was lame. I tried to flex my dominance as owner and everyone got mad. Now the server's dead, and I find it really sad.",

So a few weeks ago I had a dream when I was sleeping that I was on the bike path (I regularly go to) walking and in this dream I walked up a particular hill and this guy on a Bicycle rode by with loud blaring music! I didn #8217;t recognize the music or the singer in my dream. The guy after he rode by yelled out to me  #8220;Watch out! #8221; Anyway like I said I had this dream a few weeks ago. Now flash forward to earlier today. I was walking on the bike path went over the very same hill and the same guy with the same blaring music rode by only stopped turned around and said  #8220;I know you. I dreamed about you a few weeks ago! #8221; Wtf! Then he said  #8220;Watch out! #8221; Suddenly I looked up and a tree was falling over and I jumped out the way! Omg! The guy and the dream makes sense now. Was he some angel protecting me? If I had kept walking the tree would have fallen on top of me. But I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw him cause I knew him from the dream!",

        "content": "    Interesting title right? Im at this moment of time at the lowest point of my life, when i think back about my life and my decisions i feel tears roll over my cheeks. Im a 21 year old nobody who somehow made half a million bucks a little over 2 years ago . I owe the IRS around $40k in income taxes and around $30k of debt with other debitors. I have no diplomas and no job. I have 0$ left off all the money i earned. Im a bright kid to say the least and always thought ill find new ways to earn money. I lied to myself when my bankroll was getting low, blowing money on stupid fake friends and women. I neglected my girlfriend (still my gf). while she was walking everyday to school i had access to a $70k car in front of the door and didnt bother to bring her. I was a selfish motherfucker completely blinded by money. I have always helped everyone, my characteristic can be described as helpful,charming and friendly. I can only recall 2 instances where i have had an actual fight with someone over a 'streetlife' course of 4 years, and like we all know the streets always bring trouble. So i consider myself a really friendly guy to say the least. Nonetheless somehow people didnt like me (maybe because i had more money? Maybe because im not a snake?) And bit by bit my 'empire' started crumbeling down. I lost bit by bit 5k-10k at a time my fortune in online gambling, if u see my wagering its absolutely insane on the websites raking in over 4.5 million EUR at age fucking 21!!!! So came the big blow losing over 150.000$ in a matter of minutes. A simple thief took the slice of the cake that was my last piece. Here you are, from rolling in the dough not thinking about anything having a youth of dreams to: - Unemployed - In debt - No Education (Luckily i enrolled in a topnotch biz school for next year) - My parents support me but the emotional pain i caused them is beyond earthly (They didnt know i had so much money) - My girlfriend supports me but due to my depression i dont know how to act anymore and its taking a toll on us I completely lost the plot, everyday i stare at the ceiling in pain. I was never depressed i was the kid that was so happy that people want to punch me just bcz im too happy they used to say. Nothing is left of that, seeing old friends makes my heart explode. Hearing them go places, live life and have a good schoolfuture makes me act like a moron. Cutting off conversations while clearly the guy im speaking to is thrilled to see me after years, wanting to know how ive been, what i do etc etc I just had to take this off my chest as im literally at a point where my emotions and feelings are empty I still love everyone x",

They're hideous. But there are some seriously scary dog breeds out there that the trailer trash tough guy will acquire. Cane Corsos, Fila Brasilieros, Caucasian Ovcharka... It needs to be prohibitively expensive and a major liability to have a potentially dangerous dog. Life in prison for some of these horrific deaths by dog would be a start. I naively assumed that someone could sue me and own my house when we had a crazy, human-aggressive Aussie mix. After a few good nips on two separate occasions (no serious injuries requiring medical attention but Band-Aids were needed for one) we took him to the vet and had him put down. It was sad but it was a relief not having to be so vigilant all the time. I later found out that my state had a one bite rule. Since none of my dog's bites had been reported, he could have ripped the leg open on some random jogger and I would get a pass. That's wrong. Our next dog was a thoroughly researched Labrador retriever with great bloodlines. He's AWESOME with people and other dogs and is just a delight to have around. I don't understand why anyone would want a dog that is likely to require special containment and training in order to be as safe as possible. I'll stick with dogs that are a delight to have around.",

I #8217;m a bourbon drinker, but I #8217;ve noticed it #8217;s way too easy to fall into the habit of drinking every night when I buy a bottle for home. I exercise a ton, consume a lot of coffee in the morning, and then water throughout the rest of the day. I absolutely love coffee and the  #8220;bite #8221; it has earlier in the day, and I that #8217;s why I like drinking straight whiskey as well in the evening. MORNING CRUTCH - COFFEE - EVENING CRUTCH - WHISKEY. I really don #8217;t think I #8217;ll have a hard time replacing the evening crutch with something non-alcoholic if I can just find something I enjoy as much as I do as coffee earlier in the day. I can #8217;t drink coffee (even decaf) past 4PM or I #8217;ll be up all night. I know it #8217;s a vague question, and I shouldn #8217;t be crutch dependent to anything (even coffee), but I wish I can fill the void I #8217;m looking for at night like I do in the mornings/mid day with coffee. I honestly look forward to drinking coffee more in the coming hours when I #8217;m going to bed, than I do to drinking bourbon when I #8217;m getting off work. Any non-alcoholic suggestions (other than caffeinated drinks or Soda) that might perhaps have that night time  #8220;bite #8221; I #8217;m looking for? This is an awesome-inspiring thread.

I go to the Casino to play slots as some sort of sick social need (even though I don't talk to anybody)... so when the casinos in CA shut down, it was such a blessing for me. I've been forced to save money, \"forced\" to re-buy things that I've sorely missed in my life, investing in things that bring me happiness. I've realized a new value for my money. I've realized how sick I've been for a couple years now. I've realized how much I've lost in things that matter. All because I stopped respecting myself. The further I gambled, the more disposable I felt as a human being, and started \"disposing\" my soul, my things, my family along with it. I'll never get back everything, but lemme tell ya, this coronavirus lockdown was a wakeup call that I needed. I have passion, possessions, and value again, to myself and my loved ones. I think once in a while how much money the casinos are losing right now from corona, and I can't help but feel like \"good, they deserve it\". They robbed me of my life and my soul, devalued everything about me. Screw them. I'm so much happier now, and I've now been on the 3 sides of the coin... 1) My great life prior to gambling, 2) My shitty existence of a human being while gambling, and now 3) A new-found zest for my life. I'll never go back now... it's hard to see how much you've lost while you're in the thick of it... but now that I've got a taste of how much greatness there is without gambling, I see it. I value it. I'm done, and now living again.",

(For example, r/PrequelMemes VS r/ShitpostCrusaders would be JoJo memes featuring the Star Wars Prequels.) Those teams were composed of [four participants](https://www.reddit.com/r/memelounge/comments/cppgto/meme_lounge_tournament_update/) who were chosen by each subreddit in one way or another. Now, they've made their memes, and it's their turn to relax while you guys vote for your favorite. So how will this work? Simple, and if you visited r/GifTournament this will probably ring a bell. Each matchup will have a parent comment saying which matchup it is, and two child comments. The child comments will link to each team's meme individually, without saying which team made which meme. To vote on which submission is your favorite, you simply need to upvote the one you like, and in two days, the winner will be the one with the most upvotes. The vote will run until it's the 10th in EST time, or in two days from the posting of this thread. (Not EDT, EST; there's a difference.) May the best meme win.",

        "content": "    tldr: posted under new account, life story, will update. take care.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ It was an early autumn morning in Mars, the nurse was ready to deliver yet another baby, as she did the day before that, and the day before. But this kid was not like every other, when everybody felt satisfied, he just wanted more and more. He grew up like many others, in a loving family with a somewhat older brother. They lived in a normal house, in a normal town and had a good and stable financial situation. There was always money for food, family vacations and all the interests a young lad could have at the time. Life went on, and Billy did not really face any problems or risks, he grew up problem-free. He had good grades, good friends and fun interests. But already then you could see he was different. In his family, they always went to the local ferris-wheel, where you had spinning wheels where the prize was candy, stuffed animals or similar. Billy's siblings would spend a dollar here and there, sometimes they won and most times they lost. But Billy spent all his money, and he had to ask for more as he couldn't afford lunch. He was hooked. The following trips Billy was already ready, he saved up money, and spent it all at the wheels. Billy never won - but he never learned that the house always wins. The clock ticks on and all of the sudden Billy becomes a teen. He had not done much in life, like many others. His biggest interests where to play CS:GO, which lead to not having that many friends in real life, as he lived online. This is where he started gambling for real, he started betting cs-skins on jackpots and odds. He never won big, he just continued to deposit what he could every month. Losing and losing, even if he won it would only take a day or two before it was gone again. When Billy started high-school, playing games was not that fun anymore so he started partying. Got a nice girlfriend, a lot of fake friends that come with partying and months went past really fast. They broke up, and as the girlfriend introduced him to most of his friends, they left him as well. Now Billy was alone, isolated, and had nothing to do. So he started playing CS again, and soon started gambling. \\--- This is where Billy started getting the knack for poker, he started studying the game vigorously. And he won - lots of money, at least for 17 year old Billy. And no one knew, he did not really have anyone to show it to either. Life went on, of course there were losses, but Billy was on a winning streak. He soon became 18, and started playing both IRL and online. Half a year later Billy won the national cup for Hold'em Heads Up, with a big cash prize on the top. Billy had more money than he ever had before, so he spent it stupidly. (bottle service and cocaine). Suddenly, poker stopped paying, and Billy was furious. What had been so easy before was now impossible, he was losing and he was mad. That's when he found the golden ticket, slots. First time he played the slots he had deposited 200$, and won 10.000$. He was happy, he felt like a genius. Four days later that money was gone. Not spent in the clubs, it went right back to the casino. As many before him, he thought this was something that happened for everyone. And he wanted it to happen again. Deposit after deposit, over several years. Losing and losing. Poker was too slow now, it had to happen fast. So he either played slots or high stakes BJ. Of course always in the end loosing. When Billy thinks about it, even though he has won several thousands, he had spent maybe a grand total on other things than gambling from these winnings. \\--- And I am Billy, sitting here after a huge loss. Having absolutely nothing to my name expect the clothes on me and some shitty furniture in my apartment. I'm in debt, but i'm floating on save waters. It will get paid off, in time. And today i feel totally down. Like I never have been before. The last few days have been spent in my bed, a week ago I cashed out 16.000$, of course nothing of that is left. That could in my situation been life changing money, fuck-you money. But after I think about it, the amount does not matter. It could have been a million, and 99% would have gone back to the casino in a few minutes - hours - days or weeks. I am so done with this shit. The last years of my life have been spent in isolation. No friends, no family, I am all alone. No fun hobbies, nothing. I have been to work, spent my hard earned money on gambling. Become sad, done coke. And just repeated it month after month. My brain is to the point of being so fucked, I don't feel sad or happy, with or without drugs. I feel nothing, emptiness. Even though the last years have gone by with the wind, and I have nothing to show for it except a balance that says a huge minus. 2020 is the year that my life will start once again. It has only been on pause for a couple of years, but no more. This is the time, as now there is no need to live at all. But I don't want to go yet, I want to live before I go... \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ I will update this thread as life flows on, expect the first update to be on the first of January. Til then I am living in this trapped maze, that never ends.",

        "title": "    Unworthy Thor discussion",
        "content": "    Now that [Unworthy Thor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/4rqdzc/odinsons_future_unfolds_in_marvels_unworthy_thor/) has been announced, I #8217;d like to talk a couple of minutes to talk about my own experiences with Jane Foster and Thor in general over the last two years and was hoping others that have strong feelings about the character one way or another would respond in a polite, respectful manner about the issues they initially had with the run, if their perspective has changed at all, or if they were one of the few people that didn #8217;t mind or even liked the change initially and why. Basically, I #8217;d like to try and use this thread as a discussion board for the type of conversation I wish I had been able to have over the internet when New Thor first dropped. I #8217;d like to preface this with the fact that I am a 24 year old female. I have been reading comics off and on since I was 13, more seriously in the last 6+ years. How I view media and the world in general is undeniably filtered through the lens of who I am and the experiences I have had. The first thing you should probably know is Thor is my favorite fictional character. Hands down, point blank of anything. He is my number one. I have read every one shot with him in it from 2006 on. I have read the majority of his older books cover to cover and am currently going back over Thor V1, just because. The Mighty Thor  amp; God of Thunder are some of my favorite comic books of all time. He is one of the few comic book characters I have kept up with what is happening to the entire time I have been reading Marvel. Because of this, I knew within the first hour of the original unworthy Thor announcement. Like I said, he #8217;s my number one. My initial reaction to the news was panic. My by far favorite currently running comic was ending, I didn #8217;t know who would be writing him or drawing him in the future or if he was even going to make it out alive. After about 10 minutes of blind fear I realized I was being a fucking idiot. This was Thor. He #8217;s been around since the 1950s. There was no way Marvel was perma killing him. So, after my initial reaction I settled into a more muted mix of emotions. I thought it didn #8217;t make much since that they were taking away his name, but I wasn #8217;t furious. I didn #8217;t care who took over the hammer. I had loved every single issue of God of Thunder and was more than willing to give Jason Aaron the benefit of the doubt, if not Marvel. I was nervous, but I was willing to see where the story would lead. My best friend is 33, almost 10 years older than me. Thor is also his favorite Marvel character. He reacted a lot differently to the news. He #8217;s a very  #8216;feat #8217; centered person when it comes to comics. His idea and version of Thor is able to accomplish a very specific set of things and has been able to since he started reading. He doesn #8217;t care that Jane Foster is the person who took up the mantle. He cares that Thor was alive when it happened. That he lost an arm, his name and was defeated by a sentence. That Jane was able to take on Odin in a way Thor had never been able to in 60+ years of continuity. That it happened in his own book. To him, that is indefensible. Because of how I read comics and what is important to me, these aren #8217;t as big of issues. To me, how Thor views his own worthiness is integral to his character. It is how he defines himself. So an event that takes that away makes for a really compelling read. How Thor ended up reacting to his loss of the hammer makes him more of a hero in my eyes, not less. To me, Thor lost a lot but he didn #8217;t lose the core of what makes him my number one. Unworthy Thor was still Thor. I was sad he wasn #8217;t in an on-going, but I wasn #8217;t heart broken. It didn #8217;t fundamentally alter how I viewed the character in any way. The nice thing was, I could talk to him about this. He fundamentally disagreed with me, but he didn #8217;t make me feel like less of a person. His reaction made sense. I understood where he was coming from, even if it wasn #8217;t how I felt. That was not the case with most people. After the announcement first dropped I went on the internet to learn all I could and all hell had broken lose. People who hadn #8217;t read Thor in the last 30 years were calling for Jason Aarons head. The new Thor was female, so obviously women were ruining comics. My love of a character and opinion was somehow less valid because I was female. And all of this was somehow my fault, simply because I #8217;m a girl who reads and contributes to comic culture. Really, really disheartening things were being tossed around. So I started defending Jane Foster before I knew it was her. Because I didn #8217;t really know what else to do. All I wanted was for people to wait to read the story before deciding one way or another but there was already a line in the sand and if you weren #8217;t on the right side you had better have gotten ready to have every insult in the book thrown at you. And it turned out I was glad I did, for her. And for Thor. I loved the 8 issue run before Secret Wars. I loved seeing her and Thor interact and play off each other. I still loved Jason Aarons writing. The new run hasn #8217;t won me over quite as much, but I certainly don #8217;t hate it. I guess part of the reason I #8217;m writing all this out because I #8217;m seeing a lot of the same reactions towards the new Iron Man that I got initially when Jane Foster Thor first dropped. And I #8217;d like to offer people a different, less alienating way to express their displeasure than  #8216;fuck diversity and SJW #8217; because while I #8217;m sure some people do certainly think that way, I have a hard time believing that #8217;s where the primary source of most peoples displeasure comes from. And while it might take a little longer to type out, I think some really great conversations can come from the long hand version of those first snap judgements.",

        "content": "    Good evening all, this is my first post on reddit. Im a 28 year old male, and Im exhausted, overwhelmed and most of all defeated from the game of blackjack. Ive been gambling for 7 years, and honestly... I have no idea how I started. Long story short, I was down about 80-90k in my blackjack career and this month, i some how won 80,000 ( eighty-thousand dollars) playing blackjack. I started every session by buying in with 2k, and I would play single deck heads up with one to two hands at a time. If I won, I would press it, if I lost, I would re-bet the last bet. Moreover, I went over 22 days in the month of June and only losing the last three days... My average win on each day was $3600, my lowest being $1200 and my highest being 18k a few times.. As I started to win, I began to bet larger. Normally I would do two $200 bets, but then it progressed to two $3000 bets with double downs... With all of that being said, I won a little over $80,000 in the month of June up until the last 3 days. Im literally sick to my stomach that I lost that kind of money in 3 days. If I would have just quit playing, I would have been even in all of my losses, but now I have to swallow a big pill of humiliation and fathoming how the fuck someone could lose $80000. I want to go back and win it as Ive done so many times before, but I know that if I do, and if I lose.... I will be going to jail 100%. I want to stop this bullshit game and move on with my life. It has almost destroyed me, but luckily Im young enough to recover. what are some good tips to quit? Ive tried many times in the past, but for whatever reason, I always crawl back. Im over this shit, Im better then this and I have a problem that has consumed me",

My character was a human barbarian named named Ase that was a stereotypical soldier carrying around a big sword that somehow found herself in the middle of a plot of a love scorned evil god to end the world from some small backwater village. I actually spent most of the game failing ALL my investigation checks(-1 mod didn't help) and a good deal of my hit rolls too, luckily most of my enemies weren't doing too well on those either so it worked out. But then, at the end, during my fight with the big bad, was when this epic moment happened. I'm at half health(the dice gods were with me during this battle) and had just defeated all his henchmen as they lay scattered around the board. I landed a decent hit on him while enraged and I guess it must have been enough for my friend to bring out this baddies Ultimate move. The big bad stood back from my char as he used is evilly divine powers to called down a bolt of lightning to smite me where I stood. Well, that's what would have happened had he not rolled a NAT 1. Cue some blank stares at the dice. \"Well, as the bolt is shooting down at Ase she just casually catches it in her hands, what do you want to do with it cuz he's dead anyway?\" Seizing that opportunity for badass points, \"She charges at him, jumps up, and stabs him under the chin and then pushes the bolt down the rest of his neck and the body.\" My friend gloriously describes how I basically proceed to bisect this thing. I had an immense amount of fun and I am really excited to play again, maybe even bringing back Ase the god killer for another round;) I forgot to add I was allowed to Rage in order to win a Pie eating contest.",

        "content": "    firstly i am lvl 9 ftp tryhard capped at 3400 trophies with no legendaries . the game is great and very fun but lately it has started getting really anoying . i would also like to mention that i might be wrong about some thing i state but thats my opinion .so lets start with the reasons . firstly its the fact that legendary cards and especialy the miner are broken as fuck . i am pretty sure 80% of the time at least against me the miner player will win if he uses it to take out pumps . its always positive trade even if you try to counter the miner since he can zap and kill or deal lots of damage to everything. i know i can use mini pekka to couner it but its very low lvl which brings me to the next point.second reason is the fact that as a ftp player you can only effectively play one deck (if you care about wining). i am currently using a hog cycle deck and i want to try out other thing but i cant do that unless i am ready to go on a huge losing streak not because everything else sucks but as a ftp player you wont have enough gold to level up other cards for decks.as you know many people compain about the matchmaking matching you againt counter after winsteaks. lately i have started to feel that a lot more. i got placed against the same deck almost 6 times in a row and i lost all six. its was spawner deck which i rarely see but counters the fuck out of my hog deck then when i start wining i get placed against miner decks whick i can rarely beat . last point is legendaries are way to hard to obtain . as i mentioned before i havent got a legendary yet and probaby wont . not only are they very rare but even if you want to buy one you have to wait for about 20 days of not upgrading any cards and then wait for even longer until the one you want shows up in the shop .also can someone explaing me why they made the cap for firendly battles lvl 9 . its going to take ages to level the epics to lvl 4 even the rares are way to hard to get to lvl 7 .what i dont complaing about that many people mind is being matched against higher level people. i ve gotten used to it because i am in this position ever since i started playing the game.not saying its fair but its logical.thats all i havent decided whether or not i will keep playing the game but especially today i very very very very mad and was so nervous that i almost wanted cry after losing 400 trophies . i dont know why i minded that so much today because i always drop and climb back .sorry if the structure of the post didnt make sense at some poiont but noone is going to grade me so i dont care . btw i made a reddit account just to coplain about that.",

The 6th attack is guaranteed crit from 2.2 Broken Promises, so it's 4% chance to spawn a globe. 77% * 4% = **3% to spawn a globe.** The other 23% of the time is 5% chance ti crit, 4% chance to spawn a globe on crit, which is negligible. So it's basically 3% more health globes per minute. At 1.68 attacks per second, that's 100.8 attacks per minute, that's basically 3% more health globes, 3 more stacks of Gruesome Feast, 45 seconds more every minute.

I'm handsome, just graduated college with honors, and am probably about to get a really good paying job in a few months as well as starting my own business next year...but I just can't seem to want a relationship with a real person because I don't believe I can be happy with it.  #8203; But I grew up without my father, and I've always wanted to be the husband and the father that my mother never had for my future spouse. But the thing is...I can't have children with anime girls. No one would come to my wedding if I was marrying a dakimakura. When I talk to people irl about this, most of them don't understand. Sometimes I don't even understand. I just feel like I could connect with an anime girl because they can connect with me...whereas, at least in my experience, a real girl will connect with me for a time but then inevitably end. I just...my trust has been broken in the 3-D world. I don't want to hurt again for no reason. I feel like whenever I want to date a girl, it just always goes south, you know? I want to experience a romantic relationship, but I can only think positively about women when they don't exist.  #8203; The person I'd want to be with as a \"person\" is Beatrice from Umineko No Naku Koro Ni, but the person I'd want to be with for their looks would probably be Akeno Himejima, but there are many in between! I can see myself writing journal entries of my love for anime girls, but I feel like if I liked a real woman I'd have this sense that it's just an experience and it's all going to end soon, so why bother? I've been rejected time and time and time again. I just wish that I could appreciate my waifus without thinking I can only be with them, but I don't know if it's possible. If you have any thoughts at all...that would be much appreciated.",

I did want to lean into the more elite unit aspect of kill team and go for really small amount of very chunky and powerful units, mostly because I struggle with managing loads of units and I like painting big dudes.

Im trying to atleast get a decent to good gaming pc, so im able to play with my older brother who has a $3,500 overkill gaming rig. And also I live in Australia so if you can try to get the parts off \"MSY Australia\" or ebay  amp; Amazon, but if you cant get the parts off them, feel free to go to a Australian seller. Sorry if this is a hastle, in Australia building a pc for cheap is like finding a needle in a haystack. Thanks, Kyah",

Both of us have been suicidal before we knew each other, and we have supported each other through tough times. She's always been confused about her sexuality and identity. She'd been learning more things about herself going through 2019. But this year, things changed. She deleted all of her social media accounts and cut everyone off. I tried to reach out to her but she cut my calls and never replied to my messages. I started sending her cat photos daily, as she loved cats. She turns up out of the blue about 2 months later apologizing for disappearing and then within 23 minutes, she went off again. I stuck with my daily cat photos. Fast forward to next month, she comes back. I talked to her for a spell. I asked how she was doing and she coldly replied that she's doing fine and she doesn't want any emotional support from me. That really stung. She went off again. Continue the cat flow. Her birthday rolls around. I sent her a book set from one of her most favorite author. A single \"Thank you  lt;3 :) \" and no contact again. On her very birthday, my girlfriend broke up with me and I have been absolutely ruined and unfocused with my life since. But I've still tried to keep the cats flowing. I want to be there, supporting her throughout but she keeps cutting me off again and again, and worrying about her for so many months and the break up have really messed up life for me and I want to stop. I want to block her and remove her from my life and start anew. But I want still be around for her, because none of her other friends gave two shits about her health and wellbeing through this lockdown. What should I do?",

I'm 31 and he is 33. I did a home test at like 6am this morning, fully expecting yet another negative (I ovulated around Dec 11 and my period is expected to start on Dec 26). I just use an app tracker. I just wanted to confirm that I could have a little bubbly tonight LOL. I had so little faith I fell back asleep  #128517; #128517;, woke up two hours later to two lines and flipped out. I know you aren't supposed to read after a certain amount of time so I took another test and sure enough a slightly fainter but still two lines after a few mins. Guys, I legit dug through my bathroom trash bins (I know, gross) to check older tests for the evaporation line and all my old tests were a solid one line negative. How likely is it that I'm actually pregnant? I took a third test and again two lines with the second being much fainter than the last two. I need to stop taking tests today but I have a problem lol! I have pre-period cramps, no other symptoms associated with pregnancy. I should have waited until boxing day to test, not sure how I'll get through family Christmases while waiting for my period to appear/ not appear  #128517;. I haven't said anything to my husband, I don't want to say anything unless I actually miss my period this week but I had to blab to someone! If this is a legit pregnancy baby would be due around the date my MIL passed away very unexpectedly. Sorry for the rambling post, Happy Holidays everyone.",

        "content": "    Hello everyone, Longtime lurker that has utilized some of the advice in this subreddit on a daily basis...I have been a trying to come up with a game plan for this particular financial situation for awhile now and even if I don't receive any responses... I think it will help me to just write it all out. **Background*** 27 Year Old USAF Officer 26 Year Old Audiologist She is currently soliciting jobs and expected to receive an offer this week for 70,000-74,000 thousand a year while I currently receive 90,000 a year. She has a current total of 147,000 dollars in graduate/undergraduate school debt outlined below: * Loan 1 - $5,244.25 @ 3.40% * Loan 2 - $23,857.46 @ 5.41% * Loan 3 - $19,244.73 @ 5.84% * Loan 4 - $23,274.48 @ 6.21% * Loan 5 - $24,057.58 @ 6.41% * Loan 6 - $29,029.94 @ 6.84% * Loan 7 - $23,175.69 @ 7.21% The total balance of $147,884.13 at an average interest rate of 5.9% **We currently are not making any payments on these loans - she will not have to start paying for another 7 months** Her father left her just under $70,000 in inheritance and we are just trying to formulate the best way to tackle this debt. While we realize we might be able to do better investing the money in the market we have chosen to eliminate this debt as fast as possible. We have no other outstanding debt (two car loans under 10K, no credit card debt, 20k+ in savings for emergencies, contributing to TSP, and we both max our Roth IRA's every year.). Is it as simple of a decision to simply pay down the highest interest loans (I could eliminate loan 7, 6, and half of loan 5 with that money). We have the monthly income to support paying $4,000 a month towards these loans. With table math, putting nearly $70k towards this loan and $4,000 a month we could eliminate this debt in under 2 years. Am I totally missing something, or is this sound logic?",

        "content": "    I legitimately feel bad about needing to have this conversation with MB, but she won't stop getting onto me about stuff that was never agreed upon in the beginning. So I know it needs to happen, I guess I just want to know how you guys have dealt with stuff like this. MB has added on two priorities that she never spoke to me about in the beginning. The first is household chores, the second is coming up with a curriculum for her three kids. I feel as though my purpose for this job has shifted from connecting and spending time with the kids in fun and educational ways to giving them busywork and cleaning the house. I have done so many different things to try to appease her and it just doesn't seem like it's working, and I'm getting so frustrated and honestly, have gotten to a point where I want to sit the kids in front of the TV all day, which is something I'm terribly against. When I first started this job, she gave me a list of expectations that were pretty clear - let the kids have fun and take them out. She even added in there not to worry about housework because she had a maid. In fact, she wanted all my attention on the kids. I was very happy with this, as I am someone who understands my strengths and weaknesses. I'm a nanny because I love kids, not because I'm a 50s housewife. Also in that list of expectations was making sure the 6 year old came home from school and was able to relax, helping the 4 year old with preschool homework and learning to read and write, and reading to the 2 year old every day. So in the beginning, our days looked like a lot of fun. We'd head to the park, I'd come up with a game where the 4 year old had to write in big letters with the mulch, we would go \"fishing\" in the creek, go home and read, somewhere down the line we would have naps, lunch, and an hour and a half of TV time. Then MB started getting frustrated because those reading and writing games I'd make have no proof that I was doing them. There wasn't anything tangible. So I thought maybe pictures would help. They didn't. So maybe I could download a nanny app that said exactly when we were doing what, because I don't want the boys to do drills all day (that's one way they'll never enjoy learning). She was satisfied for like all of .2 seconds before getting upset about it again and adding on doing the boys laundry. So I gave her what she wanted, and I had them actually sit down and do something on paper. Now the 4 year old hates me because he doesn't understand why he can't play scavenger hunt with his sight words. Wonderful. But that wasn't enough, either. She asked me to come up with a curriculum that I can do an hour with them each day, which is going to take even more time at home to come up with. I tried compromising by asking if we could buy a curriculum, and I could have him do the lesson plans every day. She does it. It's still not enough, and she's frustrated that she fired the maid and I don't want to increase my originally agreed upon workload. Then she gave me a checklist of chores and activities she wanted me to do throughout the day. I kind of wanted to quit on the spot with that one. To make matters worse, DB even talked to me and gave me a new list of expectations that were pretty clear and I was okay with, but MB again switched things up on me and made things confusing. Back to the checklist. I'm getting so fucking tired of this. The boys are angry with me because they don't understand this change in schedule or myself, I'm getting angry because now the boys don't even have a nap time that I can take the time to clean or prep their lesson plans, and she's mad because she has unrealistic expectations. At one point, she told me she didn't have this problem with her last nanny. You have no idea how much I want to bring out the sarcasm. \"Yeah, she quit for no reason, didn't she?\" Just last night, I got a text at 9 PM telling me that she was unhappy with the housework I had been doing that week. Which is funny, because the boys actually came to my apartment this week because of odd circumstances, so I didn't even go over there. I know I need to have this conversation with her, and I know I might get fired for it, but I also feel incredibly guilty and not good enough because I'm clearly not cut out for this line of work if I can't even get on the same page with the parents on what my job responsibilities are.",

        "content": "    I'm currently a maintenance tech that has been given the role of a sort of \"systems integrator\" for a company in the food/bev industry. I started by turning wrenches in machinery, fabricating, diagnostic and troubleshooting controls, then was finally able to show them my programming skills on their ancient SLC 5/05 bottling line. I've been at the company for years and I'm currently that guy who's \"so valuable, we couldn't do it without you\" yet I don't feel the compensation is matching up to what I'm bringing to the table. I fully intend to go to them about negotiating wages, but first I want to have a fallback plan. I really want to stay in controls and programming, but I don't know what certs are useful to get a good job in the field without having an engineering degree. I'm very familiar with AB, I'm currently working with Siemens stuff (a lot of European machines) and I have used codesys based controls for years now. I've built custom machines, retrofitted controls, built data aquisitions systems (including installing and configuring SQL servers), deployed wireless LAN bridges for remote connection to devices in the field, designed and built operator panels, wired cabinets, deployed and configured VFDs (Siemens, AB and yaskawa) for various standalone PID controls applications as well as centrally network controlled applications. I feel I'm valuable to somebody, but I need to know what kind of credentials will get a potential employers attention.",

        "title": "    Haunted Movie Theater I Work At",
        "content": "    So, this is my first Reddit post ever. Honestly, I love reading this sub because over the past few years due to some happenings I've grown more and more interested in this stuff, and I thought I'd share some of my experiences with Reddit. I'm looking forward to any input on my stories and also to see some new stories from you guys :) Let me just start out by saying that before I worked at this movie theater I didn't truly believe in ghosts or anything of the sort; I've always been good at rationalizing things and thinking of logical explanations for any weird events that happened growing up. So when I first started at the theater a little over 6 years ago, I laughed off any ghost stories that my coworkers told me about the place. That is, until I had some experiences of my own. Something that several employees have claimed to see is a shadow person--in some cases more than one but it's usually just one that I hear about, and it's always near the end of the hallway to the south of our concessions stand. People have also reported seeing it in the same end of the building, but on the upper floor in projection. Always hanging out in or between theaters 5 and 6. Multiple employees have also claimed to see what they described as sort of a glowing silhouette of a person, which they usually would just catch a glimpse of before it disappeared, and it's been seen in multiple places. One girl once told me that supposedly a woman came to see a movie maybe like 7 or so years ago, and the woman randomly walked up to this employee and said that she can see auras and spirits and whatnot, and told her that she just wanted to let us know that we had a \"sweet little spirit\" wandering around the lobby. Something you should know is that a year or so before I started (I'm not sure of the exact date) there was a murder/suicide in the parking lot of the theater involving a man and his little girl. I'm not positive what the circumstances were, but the rumor was he was in the middle of a custody battle with her mother so he took her to one last outing to see a movie, and then shot her and himself in his car afterward. The employee that found them got a couple paid weeks off and needed therapy for some time. She doesn't work there anymore. Another thing is that apparently one of the past employees stumbled upon what appeared to have been the remnants of some sort of sacrificial ritual behind the building by the trash compactor. If I remember right, there was a raccoon(?) head or something like that back there with stones circled around it. Not quite sure what that's all about. My personal experiences include seeing that shadow person down the end of the hallway, both upstairs and downstairs; I've caught a glimpse of something blue-white and glowing out of the corner of my eye when I was in a dark theater by myself cleaning with the lights off (I shouldn't have been but it was a slow day); I'm a manager now so if I open I'll be there by myself in the morning for about half an hour before employees start showing up and I almost always hear foot steps (unmistakable steps complete with the sound of thighs/pants rubbing together and everything) walking down the hall and into the office and they stop at the desk. I used to get up if I heard it with my back turned to look to see if someone showed up early but I'm used to it happening now. I always get inexplicably scared or uneasy in both theaters 5 and 6, also in projection between both projectors (they're next to each other), even before I knew about or believed in the ghost stories. My most jarring experience was one of my first. I was cleaning theaters and I got to theater 6, which was supposed to be empty. Sometimes people sneak into theaters on slower days, so I went to make sure nobody was in there before moving on. I walked up the ramp and looked over the side of the railing and saw a lone person sitting in the middle of the row behind handicapped seating. I remember seeing facial features and everything--it looked like a middle-aged man. He looked kinda like he was glowing, but the screen was also illuminating him. I was a little annoyed since the theater was supposed to be empty but I figured that he had already made it through the whole movie as credits were about to start, and I didn't see much of a point in confronting him. I went back to the entrance of the auditorium and waited for him to come out so I could see if he'd made a mess around his seat. There are only two exits from the auditorium; the one I was standing by, and the one to the side of the screen at the end of the ramp leading into the auditorium, which I had a clear view of. Credits rolled, finished, and the lights came up. After standing for a few minutes waiting for the guy to come out, I got irritated and went in to tell him to leave so I could clean, but he wasn't there anymore. If there had actually been a person in there, I would've definitely seen them leave. Another one that really showed me that this isn't all in my head is, one time a couple came out of theater 15 and went to the bathroom afterward, etc, and started walking toward me in concession. The girl walked up to me and immediately said, \"is this theater haunted?\" I was taken by surprise and asked why, and they told me that they had the auditorium to themselves (only two tickets had been sold to it) and apparently during their whole movie they both kept thinking that they were hearing footsteps as if someone was running back and forth in the row behind them, with the occasional whispering. After the movie the girl went to use the restroom, which she also had to herself, and while she was sitting down doing her business she thought she heard footsteps walk in the bathroom, walk to the farthest stall from the entrance, and then that toilet flushed. When the girl was done, she left her stall and nobody else was in there with her, and her boyfriend said that he didn't see anyone go in either. One of the weirdest parts though? Theater 15 just so happens to be the theater that the aforementioned man and little girl had seen their last movie in (I believe the movie was Rio). I could go on about the stories I've heard about this place as well as give a few more of my own, but this is already a novella and I'm sure you get the picture. Don't hesitate to ask questions or tell me one of yours! I eat this shit up. TL;DR haunted movie theater complete with shadow people, glowing silhouettes of people, footsteps, a history of murder-suicide on the property, and what may have been a sacrificial ritual as well (really don't know wtf that was about)",

        "content": "    Hello! I'm a 16F currently seeking other literate roleplayers (Gender and age doesn't matter as long as you're respectful) who would be down to roleplay. I know that some people are uncomfortable writing with minors, so I take no offense if I'm not your cup of tea. I tend to write 2+ paragraphs per response, and I value quality over quantity. Sometimes responses will be short and fast. Others will take more time and delve into the characters. Either works depending on the scene. I love romance, but I also adore horror, fantasy, and medieval roleplays. I'm in a few fandoms as well, but I'm not really looking for a fandom rp right now. I would love to potentially delve into a Greek Mythology roleplay centering around Persephone and Hades, but I'm also open to a medieval or fantasy roleplay with original characters. I enjoy writing male/female and female/female primarily, but I'd be open to male/male if it was something I was interested in. I will go more in-depth on the Greek Mythology roleplay if you are interested. I have ideas, but I'm flexible. I am underage, so I will not write sexually explicit content. I do not have a lot of triggers, but I have one in particular I will mention if you message me. In the end, it's about how you handle certain topics - not the topics themselves. So, yeah! PM me if you're interested in talking about plots. I'm very flexible with my ideas, so don't be afraid to bring up storylines you'd be interested in as well. If you're interested in writing with me, I can send you my Discord and we can start plotting. I hope to hear from you soon!",

In early January the Canadian Head moderator deleted the entire moderation team in a breach of VoteBlue protocol to enact his personal agenda on the subreddit. Since then VoteBlue has languished with virtually no moderation or promotion of activism. In late April the mods were able to let the VoteBlue populace know what happened for approximately 4 hours before we were all banned. We have moved to greener pastures, r/VoteDEM. If you are looking to help Democratic candidates nationwide from schoolhouse to US senate get elected, that is the place to be.

Although some ravens flying around in his ult zone would be great and maybe darkening all the reds a notch would also help. While changing the hair is a model change it shouldn't be to hard given that his hair isn't animated like with some recent champions. Also I made a quick reference splash of Swain with short hair: https://imgur.com/a/FhNbJ Edit: the hair in his skins is fine tho, it's just his base were it seems unfitting",

        "title": "    Customer service horrible warning about making purchases",
        "content": "    As I always have been saying I have no problem making in game purchases to support the game but after this experience never again with any of supercells games. I purchased a 20 gold fireball card but somehow someway the next day I notice 40,000 gold missing long behold I got a sparky legendary card instead. I did not authorize the purchase and emailed customer service and this was their response. \"Hi Challenger, Thank you for writing in. I appreciate your love and support towards the game. By adding intuitive confirmation steps, we #8217;ve done everything we can to limit accidental purchases from being made in the game. When making a purchase with gems and coins, you will always be notified, and asked to proceed before spending any actual gems and coins. This has done very well in limiting these instances. Because the game is a live, online multiplayer game, reversing changes would have adverse effects on other players you've interacted with. As we can #8217;t turn back someone #8217;s progress in the game, or remove features, providing a gem refund would provide your village with something for free, which we see as unfair to other Clashers who earned the same item or upgrade through their own gems or gameplay.\" I emailed them back stating that check my battlelogs I already have a sparky card that I have not used in over two months why in the world would I waste 40,000 gold on another sparky card. Additionally their confirmation bit about gold and gem purchases is on point as there is a question mark asking you to confirm such a purchase yes that is a confirmation. And suppose I did buy a card there is only a pop up that happens but the game doesn't tell you \"are you sure you want to buy the card\" with a question mark there is no confirmation indication. At the end of the day they won't refund the gold. That's ok I just won't support in app purchases anymore. Farming resources in clash of clans is super easy no reason to make in game purchases there. Clash royale yes it's an awesome game but playing for free is just as fun too. I close with this. Imagine purchasing something on Amazon and they ship you the wrong item and you contact customer service telling them they gave you the wrong item. And Amazon customer service tells you sorry online shopper because everyone buys things online its not fair if we send you the correct item you are stuck with what we give you. Obviously this won't happen because your credit card or bank can refund you and make an investigation and Amazon will at the end correct their mistake. Problem with in app purchases in in any apps there is yet proper internal control , regulations or any oversight board. This incident is theft on supercells part and won't make that mistake in trusting this company any further with purchases. And just as a fyi the purchase of the fireball was clear as I clicked the card and the card popped up again which requires one to click again which I did so there is no mistake on the purchase made. Systems crash, fail all the time. It's not perfect. Again not asking for a refund of gold or gems. It's to correct the correct purchase.",

        "content": "    Ive been numb for the last 2 1/2 weeks and need help getting my life back....This is my first post so please excuse the length but I need support. I started like most, home game Texas holdem when I was 17. Nothing crazy, 20$ buyin. When I finally hit 21, I went to the casino for a weekend trip for my birthday. I was down $400 the first Two days and on the morning I was checking out I hit big playing 3 card poker and won my money back. What would have been a learning experience of losing, turned into chasing your loses can get you even. I went back 3 more times in 4 months and was up $3700. Shit this was easy money, WRONG! I spent the next 6 years of my life going to the casino maybe 4-5 times a year. I went with money I was okay to lose but always quit if I was up. We once drove 2 hours, sat on a machine hit for 550$ in the first 5 spins on a .25 machine, got dinner and drove 2 hours home. Over the last year as my income increased, so did my bet size and risk. I started to bet higher and would go to the ATM if I lost quick. I probably lost around 10,000 last year. At the end of the year I saw that and said to myself, you should cut back on the gambling and invest that money. So 2020 starts off well, money is coming in and Covid hits us all. I had money in accounts and made about 17,000 as the market climbed back up. The problem was at the same time, we were all in lockdown and I said f*** it lets gamble at home. I have adhd, ocd and deal with bad anxiety and sometimes depression. All of which dont go well with gambling. I started out playing slots and sports betting. Up and down small bets nothing to write home about. I started to play blackjack after a friend told me about it and the winning started. I was up close to 7,000 and couldnt stop playing. I would play on breaks at work, walking the dog, cooking dinner, none stop it was on my mind. I started increasing my bets and would lose the first 1,000 quick and would chase until I was even or up, sometimes up to 6-7,000. I was playing on winning for a while until one night I snapped. I turned 5,000 into 16,000 and hit withdrawal. That night I couldnt sleep, I kept getting the urge and finally caved. I was playing irrationally and lost all 16,000. I became numb, I could do so much for my family with that money and I f**kin blew it! Ever since that day I have chased. On two occasions I was down close to 10,000 of my money and got even to then give it all back. What the hell is wrong with me?!? I was back to a good point but couldnt stop. There were sleepless nights, screaming at myself on the car rides to work, punching myself in the arms and legs. Then came the worst day, which led to the worst two weeks of my life. I again was up 5,000 in a session withdrawal button selected and reversed it. I would go on a binge and lose close to 35,000 chasing loses that never turned around. I have had suicidal thoughts and cant come to tell my wife what I have done. I look back now and cant believe I didnt see the craziness that was going on. I couldnt go more than a couple hours without at least logging on Nd playing a couple hands. I have a baby under a year old at home and they are my world. I feel like I have wronged them and have so much guilt. We have been together since high school and she has trusted me with our finances. I have contacted an addiction counselor and my evaluation is this Friday. I still have the urge but can not do anymore harm to my family. I cant sleep and just keep playing over in my head all the things I could have provided for my family with that money. She can tell something is off but Ive just told her work is stressing me. Can anyone give me guidance on how to tell my wife about my gambling addiction?",

        "content": "    I'm just a loser. In all aspects of life now a days. 31 years old, business has been struggling. In my 20's I was the envy of all my friends. Even though I lost about 120k sports betting in the first 5 years of that decade I was making good money and it didn't really phase me. I had girls, money, lots of friends now I got the latter but zero money. Thinking about selling my house. How life can change so quickly. 21 years old I made almost 150k. 31 I made 25k. Lost 48k gambling! Slots mainly. Thinking I could get my life back on track with a lucky spin. Obviously that didn't happen. Mind you, I lost all that in 6 months. 48k down in 6 months, wtf is wrong with me. No one knows. Not my girlfriend, she'd leave me 100% if she knew. It's against her religion and values to gamble. My mom has stage 4, definitely don't want to add stress to her life. Just struggling here but I tell myself that only I can change my finances and it's something 100% in my control, whether I get part time work or hope business is better this year. I increased marketing, let go of some employees but got a 50k business loan that I maxed out last year trying to keep business afloat. I think that's what got me back into gambling after quitting in 2015. Oh well. I got 8k in credit card due to gambling. 50k business loan. And another 50k line of credit that I maxed out starting a new online furniture business that I will be maxing out once I have the website, marketing. Already have enough inventory to clear all debts, just praying that it works out. Anyway. Almost 110k in debt. Made 20k last year lol. Will have two businesses come April 1st and that will be my focus. I'm not worried about gambling anymore. It lost its magic for good. I hate stressing over money and have enough risk and gambling to do with my two businesses. (got to be smart about these risks) Just venting I guess. Hate the fact that I lost so much in such a short period of time. Makes me sick and my girlfriend keeps asking why I seem so distant. I tell her it's work stress which is only half the truth. Lying to her kills me, she's such a sweetheart. I look at life sometimes and be like what's the point in working and stressing over money and bills? My dad died when he wasn't even 50 due to mental health reasons. My mom retired and in the same year at 60 yrs old gets diagnosed with stage 4. One of my uncles whom I was very close with died at 63 to cancer. These were healthy people with no vices, farmers, eating local produce. Then I look at Kobe last weekend. Anything can happen, one day you're here, the next day you're gone. Sorry if all this seems depressing. Maybe will go back to therapy. I'm not suicidal, just wondering what life's all about. It's not money I know that. Sometimes I think of selling everything I have, leaving my girlfriend and taking the 50k+- I have in equity after clearing my debts and just moving somewhere warm and chill and just work minimally to pay the bills and enjoy life. But then I'm not like that, like all gamblers have some sort of ambition to be taking such heavy risks with their money. I'm all over the place mentally. I don't drink, do drugs but I am addicted to making money. I need to find fulfillment elsewhere. But for now, at 31, I will dedicate the next 10 years of my life to the hustle. Stay positive, faith, work hard and hopefully everything will work. Till then, don't gamble. It's shitty, losing money is shitty. The mood it puts you in after losing is shitty. Even while gambling its shitty to me now. No more. When I get that gambling urge I will just go to my shop and work on my businesses. Maybe that's more productive gambling. I'll stick to my goals and revisit this conversation in my head at 40 years old. Sorry for the rant, just finding it difficult to get over the fact I blew twice my last year salary in 6 months. Be strong brothers and sisters.",

        "content": "    Thank you for bringing the discussion to where ashen wolves fit in the tier list. I agree with a lot of your rankings. Here are some of my thoughts, though it is still very speculative: \\-Constance: She may be S or SS tier imo. Her mag stats/growths are on par with lysithea, she has bolting, and (Most importantly to me) she has rescue. The number of uses and the ability to pull back units without canto (unlike warp, they would still need canto) makes rescue incredibly valuable in maddening in my opinion. \\-Yuri: Very much speculation, but I think he may be S tier as a bowknight. His stats are on par with leonie and petra, but his access to silence is very helpful early game and prevents dropping exp in to marianne. \\-Caspar: I think he is the second best brawling character behind felix (above raph, alois, dedue, I dont count jeritza because he is path locked and catherine because she is better used in other ways). My goal with brawlers is to have 100% crit rate late game, and he has the best dex/luck potential as well as higher speed than the others. He still only belongs in the C tier, but if I were to use a brawler I'd pick caspar.",

I listen to it and its really helpful. I highly suggest it if you havent started it already. Im trying to find the courage to go to a G.A. meeting and in search of a therapist. I thought I found one and when we did a preliminary call. She asked how much I lost and when I told her, she was like Woh! And then I thought, hmmm. I dont think she is for me. Its so scary what we are going through and I dont want this judgement. Since your the first story I saw and on Day 0 like me, Im hoping we can help each other out.

Sure, but imo, it's a bit of a stretch. I much prefer Zealot Barbarian for Mr. McKown. Why? Well, there was a point in which Cade would often deffer to God in order to help him, meaning that the power of Christ is obviously not beyond this boy. Also, living past 0 HP by screaming a lot seems to be up Cade's alley.  #8203; Don: Bard. College of Glamor. Picks up chicks at bars and wooes women with his conveniently-1-minute songs. Later gets to ability to command others using his grace, and turn into a being of otherworldly beauty. Seems like Don to me.  #8203; Dillon: Wizard, due to the fact that he's THE fwob boy to take the time to be a bit more booksmart, which Wizards pretty much have to be. Evocation as his Arcane Tradition for two reasons: 1, Evocation is technically linked to healing spells and 2, Dillion with magic would probably blow shit up on his free time.  #8203; Major: Rogue, as you said. I had a bit of trouble thinking of a subclass, but then it hit me: Mastermind. Mastermind would be perfect for Major, due to the subclass helping out his Help action. Think about it like this: Cade is about to go in and wail on some guy, and Major wants to help from far away. He might not be good at shooting, but you know what he is good at? Jokes. As Cade is about to swing, Major uses the Help action from 30 feet away, pulls out one of his famous zingers, and gives Cade Advantage on his roll. B-e-a-utiful.  #8203; Turv: Drunken Master. Perfect. Simple. Slaps a lot.  #8203; Jacob: Bard, College of Lore. I mean, c'mon, this one's a given.  #8203; Fio: idk girls scare me.  #8203; ESAM: With that head? A Cleric, easily. Light domain, as the power of light comes from his shiny head. Y'know what also uses light? Lightning. You know who uses lightning? Pikachu. Done. Deal.  #8203; MVD: Fighter. Much like Cade, MVD seems like a big, strong boy. Unlike Cade, he's a lot more level-headed. A Battle Master, for precise strategy, and probably took Defense as a Fighting Style.  #8203; Eh, that's all that I've got.  #8203;",

If this would be my life forever, I would really want to rather die, not joking. Using cheap shampoos I messed up my hair, I had to spend a ton to fix it after, I gained a lot of weight from pasta-rice-potatoes (not everyone has a great metabolism), I couldnt afford acne treatment, I couldnt take care of my teeth, my self esteem was very low, I couldnt meet with people because you actually need to spend money for this, and I developed anxiety, because absolutely the slightest thing could have damage my fragile equilibrium in life in any second. The charger for laptop broke, and I stepped over my glasses... that felt like the end of the world! So yeah, dont tell me who to live near poverty, I l know the story and its a horrible one. Now in Canada I make some $19/h working for a very big company, a quite difficult job. And Im poor and its not fair. So please, instead of trying to blame people that they have no clue on how to budget, you should rather raise awareness that the salaries are too low in this country and even tho we are working, we can barley survive.

The nerve cells in the inner ear are encased in bone and largely protected from pressure changes. With one exception - there is a small hole in the bone encasement. On top of this hole sits a different bone, the stapes, which fits in like a puzzle piece. When we hear a sound, the stapes will vibrate and stimulate the nerve cells in the inner ear. If it vibrates with enough force, the nerve cells responsible for hearing will be damaged. However, the stapes doesn't vibrate with broader changes in air/water pressure so the sensory nerve cells are safe. Now of course, you can damage any part of your body with enough pressure.",

        "content": "    The SW Life Chapter 1: Wake-Up Call Life is a series of moments. Some are good and some are bad. Moments make us who we are. They complete our life. I had a moment this morning. While completing my dailies, I finally collected enough mana to open my free mystic scroll from the monthly login rewards. Before hitting the summon button I thought about all the monsters I could pull, \"Boy would I like a Perna. That's too greedy. Any lightning will do.\" I hit the button and to my surprise lightning sparks appear. A million thoughts rushed through my head and my heart started to race. The animation finishes and I see my reward: Ragion; for the hundredth time I have summoned an awakened golem. I didn't realize it, but that was my moment. Suddenly, whether I wanted it to or not, everything around me changed. My life was no longer a series of moments. It was one moment. It was this moment. I was getting ready for work like any other weekday. Time for breakfast. I need mana to make it through the day. What's in the fridge? Waffles: 5k mana. Pancakes: 50k mana. Ice pops: 100k mana. I would normally have waffles, but for some reason out of my control I grabbed an ice pop instead. This is just what I need. I ripped open the ice pop and headed out the front door ready to tackle my first scenario. No enemies in sight, I headed for the elevator. The numbers in the elevator shined a fluorescent blue and I knew exactly what was going on: it's time for the Temple of Wishes. I hit a button excited to see the outcome. Will I land on the monster square? What will be my prize? The doors opened and a little girl appeared in front of me. She looked at me pleading to join my team like the countless pixies I already had. \"Sorry, but I don't need you,\" was all I could say as I walked past her without hesitation. The little girl looked back at me puzzled and continued about her day. Just another crazy guy; what else is new. The security guard. My first encounter. He waved at me with a smile on his face. I know that look. The friendly three-man arena team that draws you in, but you end up losing because Chasun procs Violent and just won't die. No, that is not happening to me. I shouted at the top of my lungs awkwardly, \"See ya later fuckface!\" and quickly walked out the door to avoid wasting an arena wing. I smiled having managed to avoid being fucked over by violent procs. As I headed for the train I realized the ice pop wasn't enough mana for me. I grabbed some fruit snacks from my work bag. 5k mana. Are you serious? That's it? I ate them quickly and kept walking. I was close to the train station when I saw a quarter on the floor. Holy shit, a rune. I picked it up to study its properties. This is a nice fucking rune. It's not legendary but it will do. I put it in my bag and figured I would equip it later. Finally, I reached the train station. This was a successful scenario all thanks to that rune. I'm ready for the next. I got out my Metro Card, swiped and entered. If only I knew what boss encounter awaited me on that train. The SW Life Chapter 2: A Destined Encounter I walked on to the train ready for my anything. The first stage was easy; I found an empty seat right away. Perfect, I can restore my energy. The train pulled out from the station and we were on our way. The very next stop is when it all began. A panhandling Mariachi band boarded the train. Three men wearing sombreros and carrying instruments spoke in a foreign language to the passengers. They started playing an upbeat song. This was quite the opponent. I grabbed the rune I found earlier hoping it had some innate properties to help me. Suddenly, I heard someone shout at the band, \"You guys suck!!!\" I knew right there this was the perfect chance to \"fight with a friend.\" I shouted at the band as well, \"Get the fuck off the train assholes!!!\" I realized the rune I acquired must be a Rage rune so I rolled it towards the band hoping to strike a crushing blow. My tactic was a complete fail. Sure enough, the band changed to a different song as we approached the next train stop. It was a lullaby. This was not good. I have no resistance to this kind of attack. I woke up several stops later. Fucking overpowered Mariachi band CCed me. I knew I lost that fight. I woke up with a groggy feeling and felt it time to use crystals to revive. I searched my belongings and found a bag of Doritos. This should help me make it to the end of the scenario at the very least. Still can't believe I lost to a fucking Mariachi band. A few stops more and it would be time to move on. Out of nowhere a guy sat next to me. He stuck out his hand and said, \"Hey, I'm Jeff. I'm the one who told that band they suck before you told them to get the fuck off.\" I get it. He wants to friend me. I definitely have space; awesome. I took his hand in mine and said, \"Yeah, they did suck. Thanks for saying something.\" At that point, the train reached my stop. I said, \"Here's where I get off mate.\" Jeff said, \"Cool. If you ever need anything let me know. Hope to see you around.\" I stepped off the train knowing I may have lost a battle, but I didn't lose the war. I headed towards my next scenario: work. The SW Life Chapter 3: F2P I'm your average guy. I wake up, get ready for work, take the train in to the city, and then sit at a desk for 6 hours and 58 minutes; one hour for lunch and I always leave two minutes early. Accounting is a numbers game. You take pieces and fit them into a puzzle. And if something doesn't work, you make it work. So day in and day out, I sit at a desk in a dress shirt and dress pants making it work. Of course, I always have my cell phone near me or I would probably die of boredom. I stood in front of my office building just like any other day. But, remember, I had a moment this morning. So it wasn't just any other day. Today was different. I studied the building unsure of the challenges before me. This is surely the Tower of Ascension. I looked up towards the sky and the many stories of office windows. Excited to enter the building for the first time in several years, I pushed my way through a revolving glass door. First stage looked easy. A security guard and receptionist. Nothing I can't handle. I nodded to the guard easily defeating him. He's my bitch. I came to a security gate. This must be how I get to stage two. I searched my wallet and found an odd-looking keycard. This must be how I get in. I swiped and made it through. Success! Level two. There were two options here: an elevator and stairs. I already made a wish this morning. I'll take the stairs so I don't waste any crystals. I started walking up the first set of stairs. My office is on the third floor so this stage should be a breeze. However, an oppponent headed towards me. I saw a very tall woman with flowing black hair and a briefcase. She stopped on the floor above to look at her belongings. Before proceeding, I made the decision to take a peek and see if I was a match for her. Her briefcase contained more tresures than I could possibly imagine. She had shiny objects, a million trinkets and a large bag of Doritos. I thought to myself, \"Shit, she must be play-to-win.\" I don't stand a chance. I stayed where I was for a minute to see her close up her briefcase. She then walked off into the second floor office area. Thank god; that could have been a disaster. I don't have any crystals for revive. I would have been done for. I continued making my way up the stairs and saw a bag lying on the floor in front of me. It was the bag of Doritos I saw in her briefcase earlier! I wasn't sure if she was mocking me for being a noob, or if she was a friend. I closed my eyes remembering the people I had added in the past. Nope, she's not on there. I don't think any of my friends are pay-to-win. I grabbed the crystals and shoved them in my bag. If it's a handout, I'll take it. I'm probably gonna need it to make it through the trials to come. I made my way up to the third floor and walked towards the office area. Outside the area was a vending machine full of items: Doritos - 100 Crystals Ruffles - 50 Crystals Snickers - 100k Mana Kit Kat Bar - 50k Mana Gunmy Bears - 10k Mana Chewing Gum - 50 Energy I was extremely tempted to buy crystals, but remembered the generosity of the woman with black hair. Who was she exactly? Anyway, I'm F2P so forget this store. I turned towards the door to enter the office. Stage 3, here I come. The SW Life Chapter 4: Repent I walked through the office door expecting the smell of coffee and co-worker sweat. But, I was back on the train again, sitting in the exact same seat, as if I had just got on. Wasn't I just walking? Why am I on the train again? We approached the next stop. I remembered the Mariachi band from earlier. This is where they get on and CC me. Fuck, I don't want to go through that again. We pulled into the station. But, no band came aboard. Ok, now I'm really confused. What the fuck is going on? I closed my eyes and sifted through the events that transpired this morning. What happened next? That's right. Jeff shouts at the Mariachi band. That's it! Jeff! I quickly looked around for my friend. He was at the other end of the train. I made my way towards him hoping to get his attention. I hope he knows who I am. If this scenario holds true, I wouldn't have actually met him yet. Suddenly, a woman standing near the train door started shouting at me, \"May the Lord have mercy on your soul! Repent for your mistake and you shall be absolved of your sins!\" Damn what a lunatic. What do I do? Wait a minute, if the Mariachi band never boarded, I should still have that Rage rune! And this is one bat shit crazy bitch! Perfect! I checked my bag, took out the quarter and handed her the rune. She looked at it briefly and then calmly put it away in her pocket. She smiled at me; success. Having cleared that stage I made my way closer to Jeff. I sat next to him and stuck out my hand. He took it in his and said, \"Looks like you could use some help, friend.\" Thank god he recognized me. \"Jeff, what the fuck is going on? I shouldn't be here. Hell, if this is real we haven't even met yet!\" Jeff smiled, \"Man, you really are a fucking noob. You seriously don't know what's going on?\" I sat there more confused than ever. He continued, \"Let me guess. A black haired woman with a briefcase dropped a bag of crystals right in front of you. And you thought, perfect, free crystals, life couldn't get any better.\" Shit, how did he know about the black haired woman and those free crystals? \"It happens to a lot of people don't worry. That isn't an ordinary woman. She's a succubus. You've been put under a curse. It's similar to the Mariachi band's sleep CC, but a hell of a lot more powerful. You just need a way to counter it.\" Now it all made sense. I'm not back on the train from this morning. I never made it to the third floor offices. I was tricked by a succubus. Damn, ToA is no joke. \"Jeff, what can I do? I shouldn't even be here. Hell, I'm not really here!\" He pointed towards the crazy bitch who shouted at me earlier, \"She already told you how.\" I thought through what she said. \"Repent for your mistake.\" That's it! I reached into my bag and grabbed the Doritos the black haired woman left for me. \"Thanks Jeff. You really are a good friend. Appreciate the help bro.\" He nodded with a smile. We pulled into the next station. As the train doors opened, I threw the bag of crystals out as far as I could. Suddenly, the world around me started to collapse. I knew I had done it. Everything faded to black and slowly back to a very real color. I was back on the third floor right outside the offices. Thank god that's over. I won't make the same mistake again. And with that, I once again made my way into the third floor office area.",

        "content": "    Hey, I think this is the next step posting for others to help me. Basically, Im a student, and have made A LOT of money matched betting (so technically, not gambling) over the last 3 years. Lived a life of luxury and had 30k in my bank ready for a house deposit after uni. Never really played casino except free spins etc. Fast forward December, I get into blackjack. 50-100 hands for fun on the train etc. Somehow. I martingale and lose 7 times in a row and spend 14k I had in my VIP account. This was horrid and happened so fast, and I spent hours trying to win it back and ended up losing another 8k. I was devastated, in tears with both family and Gf. She forgave me. I vowed to NEVER touch casino again and just stick to matches sports betting which built me my fortune. Thing is, to make big money you need a big float. Mine was down to around 7k. Yet the last 35 days I busted my gut everyday alongside study and somehow had my most profitable month EVER. I made 8000 in 35 days. I wanted my 30k back by summer and boom by end of Jan I was at 15k. Feeling so happy and proud. Gf elated, everything looking back on track. Now fast forward to today, in short, somehow I relapsed. I lost 300 from a matched betting error, I had 7k in that account, and I dont know how but ended up spinning 100 slot spins. I went back up from 4 to about 6-6.5k a few times. Left my phone at 6.5k and thought 500 loss thatll do. Now I dont know what came over me but I picked that phone up and started spinning again :(. 50-125 spins hoping for a huge huge payout. Before I know it that 7k is 2k. I then turn to roulette, stuck 1k on top third and its in! I can cash out with just a few K loss. But NO I end up playing all the way down to 0 again. I feel so stupid and a different person, How could I! I wanna smack myself! So now Im down to like 5-6k again savings and float. Ive had two sessions now losing 22k and 8k overall. SO much money. Matched betting is my only source of income as well so I needed that float. I just dont know what to do. I will start busting my gut again after exams, as hard as it will be, to repeat and make it back (I usually make 2-3k a month). How can I avoid this happening again? I hate myself so much. But I feel after years dealing with 10s of thousands on exchanges etc, I have no emotion. If I had 7k cash I would never even put 100 on a roulette table! I also have 5k in credit cards which for the LIFE of me I dunno why I didnt clear sitting on 30k. What can I do moving forward? I HAVE to matched bet/use betting sites as its my only income. I can make 100-200 a day nearly everyday. Sorry for the long post, have an exam in 20 hours I havent even studied for because of this.",

I think it would be nice if I could use a small streamer as background noise while I do my work, but someone that I could also just interact with periodically to check out how things are going with them and their stream. I'll watch pretty much anything, I don't mind what the game / content is. The 18+ thing in the title just refers to the age of the streamer, not the content(!!!!), please only reply if your content is SFW... \\----------- **EDIT: Since this post has exploded with responses, I think it would be a good place for anyone to find small streamers to watch, so please feel free to keep posting your Twitches here!**",

        "content": "    I #8217;m no where near a 4.0 student, so I thought it #8217;d be interesting to share my admissions journey so far. I #8217;ve had ADD all my life, but I only got diagnosed back in August of last year. Because of this, my grades have really suffered, and I have a GPA that #8217;s well below average. So far, I #8217;ve applied to nine schools. I got accepted to Central Washington University and Eastern Washington University while I got rejected from University of Portland. I #8217;m still waiting to hear back from Washington State University, Oregon State University,(both campuses) Western Washington University, University of Oregon, and Carroll College. Honestly, I #8217;m not too surprised that I got rejected from University of Portland, but it still stung. However, a part of me is glad that I didn #8217;t get accepted. I went to visit last month, and while I loved the campus and all the programs they offered, I felt like I didn #8217;t really connect with the place. Even still, when I opened up the portal and saw the rejected letter, I sunk into a mini depression. Even though I didn #8217;t feel like I belonged there, I still wanted to at least have it as an option. With Central and Eastern, I definitely think that if I don #8217;t get accepted anywhere else, I #8217;ll be picking Eastern. I got accepted into a program that helps keep students with low gpa #8217;s in high school on track. It would also allow me to move onto campus a week before everyone else which I would really enjoy. Right now, my top choice is Western as I visited back in May, and instantly fell in love with the place. I #8217;m just really really really scared that I #8217;m gonna get rejected due to my low gpa. That #8217;s what I have so far. I might update later if anyone is interested. Like I said in the beginning, I just wanted to share my experience since it doesn #8217;t seem very typical for this subreddit. I hope you enjoyed!",

Funny thing is, I would only bet $100 per hand and Id only do it every few hands or so alternating between low bets. I made all my money without ever betting more than $399 in order to avoid W2Gs. But once I made a nice profit for the day instead of stopping Id start bleeding off chips and then Id place those big bets to recoup. Once I started using the limits settings I was able to control and earn a good chunk back without having to deposit more money. Ive only deposited a total of $2k in order to earn back $15k. I thinks thats the part that keeps bringing me back. The fact that Ive turned a mere few hundred dollars into thousands over and over again but always go on tilt and lose it. But since I havent actually lost any of my own money since April, I keep going back. I cant shake the thought that I can make back the remaining 10k, close the accounts, and be done with it. Gambling aside Im in great financial shape so I am perfectly happy with accepting the 10k loss and moving on. But the fact that I know Ive made that back so many times with just a few hundred bucks doesnt seem like a risk when I deposit the money, and then immediately set a limit so I cant deposit anymore. I just cant stand the cycle of ups and downs and guilt.",

No jockeying for who gets top billing - Westbrook and George are both comfortable with where they fit. Its really a rare situation to find a professional sports team absent almost any conflict and I think its testament to Presti and the front office. Our only issue right now is Westbrooks shooting but I have to believe that will improve eventually. Hes in a slump but he isnt panicked and I dont think anyone else is either. Good vibes and a good record. Alls well for now. Itll be interesting if Parsons is an interest because he has been a less than harmonious presence on other teams.",

        "content": "    I remember one day at church, the speaker played a recording from Charles Templeton to illustrate a point. This was many years ago, and I don #8217;t remember anything except for a few words that were said on the recording with such emotion:  #8220;I miss Jesus #8221; and he said a few words about how it would be nice if there was someone like Jesus in the world. I pitied him as I listened to that recording because I knew Jesus and had such a peace about everything in the world. And now I miss Jesus. My faith survived my marriage failing. It survived getting arrested and spending two years in prison. While I was there, I was considered a preacher/teacher and I taught what I knew and I spent the majority of my time reading the Bible. Which in fact started the process of losing Jesus. At the time I didn't have access to other resources besides the Bible, so as I read it over and over, I #8217;d keep coming across, well, problems, contradictions, and more questions than answers. It didn't shake my faith, but it led me to research things once I got out. And now here I am, fairly convinced that Jesus was a man crucified by the Roman Empire, but a resurrection doesn't seem likely. I can #8217;t call myself an atheist because I still believe there is a god, or something bigger than us. Even if you could prove everything about the most die-hard evolutionary theory, I #8217;d still be convinced there was an intelligent designer who set the wheels in motion. Life seems way too complex to me to believe it #8217;s all just a series of great coincidences (that had to overcome significant odds). But who is this designer? I don #8217;t think Jesus was his son. Maybe he was the God of the Jews? Doesn't seem accurate enough. Maybe he doesn #8217;t wanting us knowing him? I #8217;m emoting because I #8217;m particularly depressed today. And I wish I knew that there was some reason to have hope. Jesus was a source of hope, and I miss that. But my fellow christians that were in my life before my arrest are pretty much gone. The few that have kept in contact with have added to my disbelief when I see how messed up their theology really is. I've got nothing against christians who do believe in Jesus and the divinity of scriptures. But when I see one of them treat another person like crap #8230;well, I have yet to see a regular church goer become convinced that anything they did was in fact a violation of scripture and repent. It #8217;s as if the repentance happens once and then they have a self-righteousness about them from that point forward. It #8217;s particularly frustrating because I have seen lives changed #8230;people who like me who were pretty worldly and then they got  #8216;born again #8217; and became better people for it. But then somewhere along the line they just become religious and ultimately their own god, because they let their heart guide them on right and wrong and become oblivious to how unforgiving they are towards certain people. If I didn't have my sons, I #8217;d probably be dead already instead of sitting here typing this. Obviously suicide is an extremely selfish act and at least my kids, if no one else, would be negatively affected. But if there is no objective standard for right and wrong, what difference does it make if I commit a selfish act? That #8217;s my battle at the moment. Any ideas towards why selfishness is worth avoiding or ideas of something to look forward to or have hope in are welcome.",

So I thought now's a good time to quit no bong maybe I'll just vape a little to ease myself off, i couldn't even make it a day I ran out and bought a bong, and started pounding them, that's the longest I've been in months and I couldn't even last a full day, the problem is in my country everyone smokes there weed with tobacco mixed in so I'm addicted to both, even though I don't smoke cigarettes by themselves, it's crippling me now this addition and I just want to be clear headed for a full day. I don't know how to stop when it's gotten so bad to this point I smoke all day I only stop to go to work then even then sometimes at lunch. I've tried everything, I'm going to the gym regularly but I still get high before and after, I eat good food and get all my micro nutrition, weed is really the only unhealthy thing I do but it's to such a high level it's killing me. Do I wing myself off? Do I only smoke green bongs or green vape, until my nicotine addition is gone then quit? I need help, please. Also one of the things I'm really scared of with quitting is the dreams, I don't want them to come back, I went to war in Afghanistan a number of years ago and I really don't want that to come back.",

        "content": "    I almost have 1 year since my last gamble. So glad this hell finally seems over. But I don't understand how I did this. I also suffer from drug addictions and those make sense to me. The drug hijacks my dopamine reward system and I crave and keep using. But I constantly am so puzzled how this happened with gambling. It all started when I was using drugs and couldn't think properly to begin with. I put all my savings in Bitcoin in 2017 during the bubble. I had nearly 140k from like 40k \"invested\". Then it all crashed early 2018. I was left with 50k. Then had a great idea while high to try gambling on a bitcoin casino to get my money back. Then had a horrible gambling addiction start after I won 10k one night in 30 mins. Then lost 20k in the next 30. Then over the next 1.5 or whatever years I kept gambling to try to get it back. I lost 100k to the casinos during this period. Now having stopped gambling for almost 1 year, and off drugs for half a year, I just can't comprehend how I did this. I understand that it effects dopamine just like any other addiction, but it still doesn't make sense to me how I did this. When I put all my savings in Bitcoin it made sense to my drug influenced mind since it was going up like crazy for a year. But I never took anything out. I was already addicted to gambling and honestly didn't recognize that was gambling or I was in denial. I never took anything out. Told myself if it crashed I would be fine long term with my job, and it was worth the risk since \"Bitcoin could go to 1 million.\" But I couldn't handle it when it crashed and turned to the casinos. Just so angry how stupid these markets are. I love the technology which is why I got into it to begin with. But how its all literally insane speculation is so frustrating. I wish it never existed now. Im mad for being addicted to drugs. I was sober for a while and was really cautious about bitcoin. Never thought i would put all my money in it. But then I relapsed on drugs at the start of the bubble and it seemed like a good idea.",

        "content": "    I'm an active AM user since last Summer. A have around 800 songs in my library, lots of custom playlists. I interact with it a lot  #8212; like and dislike songs, albums and playlists, add to library, rate playlists, etc. I'm trying really hard to give AI the data it needs. The Chill Mix was always awful for me, I dislike about 90% of songs there every single time. The New Music Mix is pretty good sometimes. Recently I had a short business trip to Russia and Ukraine (I'm from Finland). I don't know if this is a coincidence, but since then, for three weeks in a row, I keep getting Russian and Ukrainian music in my New Music and Chill Mixes. I have no interest in it, and I truly hate those songs, they aren't even remotely close to what I like. Actually, they are very similar to the things I actively disliked on AM over the months. Today is Friday, and I got another playlist like that #8230; This makes me so sad. Sometimes I think I should just abandon this whole \"For You\" portion of AM and just use it as a source of music files, you know, old school: build your own library and don't rely on algorithms. Other times, I think I should just delete my account and start afresh, carefully feeding the AI, but I don't really trust it. I don't feel my likes and dislikes do anything, similar to those fake elevator buttons. The whole recommendation engine feels like a ten line script with a random number generator. Before AM, I used Spotify for several years. The recommendations were not great, but pretty consistent. Consistently mediocre. I liked roughly half of what it offered. But I switched to AM because of a tighter Apple integration and because I dislike Spotify's UI (especially desktop). I don't know why I'm writing this here :-) Just needed to vent I guess. What would you do? Just keep disliking that stuff and hoping for the best?..",

        "content": "    I've had situations with Link's AI as a lvl. 9 cpu, as he would always perfect-edge guard with his Up-B on FD, which really is a complete overkill since it launches you out of range of the stage 84% of the time if it hits a few frames after he starts the attack. Now I'm not sure if this was in Melee or not, but even if it was, it's still something to be looked at and reconsidered. I actually did a test to see how one can do if you just spam ground Up-B on FD (tested with a 2v1 lvl.9 cpu, no FF, 4 stock), where I compared the match with my normal mains (CF, Marth, Ike), and the results were almost identical. With Link's Up-B spam, ended up with almost winning (cpu's having 1 life each, me with 78% damage at the last second of the match). Compare to the regular match, ended up winning Marth's/Ike's matches, losing with CF in a 1v1, having 10X% damage, and cpu having 24% damage. TL;DR: You can almost win a 2v1 with lvl.9 cpu's by just spamming Up-B with a bit of precision, than by playing at a high competitive level with your best mains (having knowledge on advanced techniques and having enough practice/skill to execute them properly).",

        "content": "    I can't keep doing this. I can't believe this just happened, AGAIN. I am such a broken person, my brain just doesn't work right with addictions like this. I'm 41 years old, I have a great high-profile job that I love, I'm respected in my community, I have a 4 year old son who is the most precious gift I've ever received, and I CAN'T STOP GAMBLING!!! I've dug holes so many times, then climbed out of them by a winning streak, or by family help, or by debt relief, and I've built things back up, life appearing to go well, then BOOM! I had dug a hole of about $15k a little less than a year ago, finally fessed up to my wife who was understanding and willing to help me with managing my money, I gave her all the passwords to my accounts, etc. That lasted for a few months, I got a promotion at work, then decided to dip my toe in the water again... Crash and burn, then recover, ended up +$2k or so. She found out by checking my statements, I assured her that it was one last spurt I had to do, I was lucky that I finished up ahead, blah blah blah. Then this past week I see a sports game coming up that I'm pretty sure about the outcome so I look into doing a small bet online. Before placing the bet though, I try a quick double up via online blackjack, because why not? Lost $100. Re-bought $200, lost. Re-bought $500, lost. Re-bought $500, lost. Re-bought $500, doubled to $1k, lost next hand. Re-bought $500, dealt blackjack, up to $1250, lost next hand. Re-bought $500, doubled to 1k, doubled to 2k, tried to win an extra $100, zeroed out within seconds. Couldn't re-buy anymore. Devastated. All of this took about 10 minutes yesterday morning. This morning, 24 hour window has passed, I can re-buy again! $500, lost. Another $500, lost. Another $500, doubled to 1k. Doubled to $2k. Switched to smaller bets, worked it up to $2300, placed a $500 sports parlay, worked it back up to $2300. Switched to video poker, hit a $2k win, now I'm at $4400, plus an outstanding $500 bet to win $1800. I go outside for a while and play with my son, daddy is happy again! Can't leave it be, I go back to my computer and work the $4400 up to $5300. I'm now at break even for the past 2 days, plus I still have that parlay out there. Back outside to play, daddy is being happy and loving some more! Come back and watch games, the parlay ends up winning! Now I'm at $7250. I can withdraw $5300 to break even, and then I'll still have $1950 online to play with!!! But who wants $1950? Need an even $2000. Blackjack for $100, win! Boom! I did it! I can call the online casino rep to get my bitcoin withdrawal fastracked, yes I'm such a degen I have a regular rep who helps me with withdrawals at an online site. But then I remember, there's usually a fee with withdrawal. Let's try to get another $100. I have freaking $7350, I can afford to place tiny bets like this. My son is trying to play with me, but I can't stop shaking, I'm getting irritated with him, I want to focus! I blow him off. $100 blackjack, lose. Rebet X2 button, man that thing is soooo easy to click. So considerate of casino to have that there for me to immediately recover my losses. Bad hand next so I surrended, now when I click RebetX2 I'm gonna win even more! But I lose. RebetX2, Lose again. I'm not even checking to see what the amount I'm betting is, I'm purposely avoiding it because I can't face it. My account balance is down to the $5k range I believe, I barely peek. I need a win. Dealt an 11 with dealer showing 5. Eff it. Double Down!!! I get a 7. Dealer gets a 6, then an 8. I can't breathe. I just need a win. No more ReBetX2, I manually enter the $2500 max bet, KK for me, A showing, can't afford insurance. Click button to continue play, there's that brief pause in gameplay that I know all too well. Dealer shows a Q to go with the A and the chips vanish. I have $130ish left, try one more hand, lose. Boom. Account down to $.17 or whatever the hell it is. I had done it. I had recovered the \"devastating\" loss from yesterday, plus extra to continue to play with. I just needed to withdraw and go back to trying to be a father. But I couldn't. Again. Of course this isn't the first time this has happened. I've played on my phone in the car while driving with my son who I claim to love so much. I was on a boat with my son at a lake on vacation, and instead of enjoying myself I was trying frantically to recover losses from earlier in the day via a cellular connection. That vacation ended up with me recovering all of my losses, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! What a great story! What a perfect way to end a gambling career! I had my new job, I had hit bottom before and had to scrape back from next to nothing and I had done it. Yet I can't stay away. I can't keep doing this. I have so much good in my life but I feel so empty. I'm earning enough currently that I won't be in debt, it's just the $ that I had started to save is all gone. I loved the feeling of being a winner, as recently as one hour ago. Felt like a big shot. Thinking of what I could casually spend $ on, in such a good mood, playing with my son, etc. No idea if my wife is checking statements again, but if she is she'll obviously discover what happened soon. I'm sick. I have no control. Enough is never enough. Please let this be the last time. Let this be my bottom. I know I could go lower, I still have a little bit left in the bank, I could try to run it back up, maybe my next $500 deposit will be a lucky one and I'll end up allll the way back up to $7350 again??? Except I'll need another $500 now to get back to where I was... It'll never end. Please help me to realize this. I'm sick.",

I didn #8217;t expect this thread to get this attention, but I have to say that a lot of your comments have helped me a lot! I realize that I have been playing blind for too long and I deserve better, I #8217;m honestly embarrassed by my behaviors and actions. Majority of you guys give great advice! There are a few that should stop before they make somebody hurt themselves. Saying that someone  #8220;wants #8221; to be cheated on after they #8217;ve been hurt and manipulated is probably not the greatest thing to say! I wanted to say thank you to those of you that gave your imput but I will probably not be active in this thread for much longer. Also sorry if I did not engage with you, I spent the day in my emotions, I still read and took into consideration what everybody said! [SCENARIO] I (27f)knew that my (25m)boyfriend had a reddit account because he shared the name with me at some point. We are not connected on any social platforms. It #8217;s not my proudest moment, but I did a bit of snooping on the only platform that I was absolutely sure of his account name(I didn #8217;t access his account with a password, it was all public comments and stories). He has cheated on me before hand and that is why I creep from time to time. But I don #8217;t access accounts with passwords I found him commenting in forums soliciting sex with couples that are twice his age, single people as well, people in our area (this was three days ago). He also had multiple stories involving his ex-girlfriend (from months ago) Had comments saying she is  #8220;the one #8221; or  #8220;the girl that got away #8221;. We have been dating for three years! I also read a lot of stories about himself, memories that he #8217;s shared with me. I felt like they were twisted or portrayed in different ways. I feel like I don #8217;t know this person. He confirmed that yes it was his account but fed me a bunch of bull about what he was doing. What do I do form here?! Edited for details*",

        "content": "    I made an awful mess about a month ago with my problem gambling. I didn't make it disappear, but it's gonna be possible to continue living with it. Problem gambling has negatively affected my life for decades. In my case, it seems to be progressive in regards to how bad and quickly it can take away everything I have. About a month ago, I was drinking and using a lot. In 2 days, I threw all the money that I could get my hands on into video poker. I lost all the money in my pocket and checking account and went robot destructive. Gambling sucks me in and holds me like a tractor beam. After losing all I had, I proceeded to get 2 tile loans on both of my cars and 2 payday loans totaling close to $6000. I lost it all. The shame and guilt and remorse and self loathing is beyond description to anyone who is not a compulsive gambler. The payments, which there was no way in hell that I could come up with, were due next week. The fear just about paralyzed me, but I was able to get a 13% loan for $6000 to pay off the obscene high interest 4 loans. Just going into those quick loan places gives me the creeps. I think, what the fuck was I doing, what the fuck was I thinking.... And it's not the first time, but I pray it will be the last. I'm really glad that this sub is here because I was sure that I was the only sick fuck who could do something so insane and self destructive and stupid. Thanks everyone for sharing and I plan to not place the next bet, with the help of this sub and by taking action to put my affliction into remission.",

We are not bad, we fought in 2 world wars, won a war against the best military in the world (at the time), fought for freedom in vietnam and fought terrorists that killed innocent civilains. And dont even get me started on slavery, yes we did it. Was it right, no, but MANY other countries did it too but that doesnt ever get brought up. Also literally HALF of America fought against eachother for blacks freedom. Another thing that we have held over our heads is about thw Native Americans, we fucking spared their lives. All throughout history when one country takes over the natives get wiped out, we let the indians live and let them have some land. Im tired of people holding that over our heads when we were pretty damn generous compared to the rest of history. We also dont stand up for bullshit by others, ex) North Korea, they were threatening us and we put an end to that real quick. We also have a right to bear arms and the right to say what we believe and freedom of religion, not something many countries can say. All in all were pretty damn fucking awesome and frankly im sick of people like you saying we are terrible. Ps: I needed to get that off my chest, its been pent up for a while, sorry i wrote it to specifically your comment. This one just was the last straw. Also to those that see this: i really dont care whether you downvote me, i wont be bullied into submission by people that dislike my beliefs. God bless, have a good day! :) (I really mean that)",

As to be explained he is a shortened fetus, as his mother abortened he and his twin brother to have twin females. And his father was absent for most of his life and at a the age of 16 he accidentally got his future wife pregnant and during her father finding out he made him never see her again. The king of destruction and swords he is someone no one should mess with as he has no empathy for human life nor animal life as his only goal is to see his child and his wife. At his young age of 17 he lost his empathy for human life after he killed his mother and father to try to see where his family is, his family is the only one to get his humanity back and his common sense. He is the god of fire but he has a unique fire color, it seems to match his complexion and hair but not much could still be said for his eye color, is a Amber color but his right eye is covered to prevent people from seeing a blind eye, his left eye seems to only have color to it, as is commonly known why his right eye is that cause of a accident with his brother. His attire is a whole black suit but his white flannel shirt is covered by a long black coat going down his knees, he has black trousers and has bandages on his arms to cover his burn marks on his hands and his whole attire arm. They may not look like twins but they are, as his brother has black hair and a perfect white skin, they only thing they could be compared to either is their looks and they're eye color and also hair as they both have hair going down to there neck and a slipped back hair style but his is more messier than his brothers as there are bangs sliding down all the time, but the key different is their height, he seems to be under 5'9 and 5'10 and his brother being 6'0 or so. Introduction. As he seemingly re-emerge from amount of deprey he made and white flames still ongoing. It seems as if he was in a fight with a fellow god. As he walks towards more towards to the main center of the town he is stopped by the god of spears by than another fight begins and the god of spears questions who made him a god anyways, as the battle begins they are interped by the brother. He seemed to have stopped the fighting.",

        "content": "    This is something I've pushed off for far too long. I feel like my head is going to explode and I honestly don't know how to fix it. I could type forever, but I don't have the energy right now, so I'll try to keep it short Basically I DREAD my career. Even though it's good pay, a good company, good coworkers, I DREAD doing the actual job. I've come to find, if I don't have an actual passion/interest in the work, I literally will have a mental block that will stop me from doing the work. I literally spend 7 hours on Reddit and MAYBE an hour doing work. Even on big projects, I just can't get myself to give enough of a shit to do it. I simply don't care for the work= I'm not doing it. Call that what you will, but that's just how my brain operates. This is obviously a problem. I get work done still (Last minute), but it's not fair to the company, or myself to not give it my all. Now the obvious answer is, \"Well quit.\" Well the fun part about my brain, is that when it wants something, it wants it NOW. I could quit and have to deal with some financial troubles, but I want job security NOW. I could quit and look on indeed for a job, but I want a job I have a passion for NOW. I could look on indeed and find a whatever job for now until I figure my career desire out, but I have NO CLUE what I want to do with my life in terms of a career, but I want the perfect career NOW, so I'm not quitting my job until I have it. As of now I'm financially comfortable. I want a job with the same pay, piques my interest, but I want it NOW. I don't want to do 2 years of school while working this current career. \"Then quit and work a job part time while you go to school.\" That puts my financial comfort in jeopardy NOW. See where I'm going with this, and why I'm in a rut? Well, some slight good news is I've recently taken a liking to programming. This started when I found out I could program my wifes Echo Dot to control Directv. That's badass to me, and I know you can do a lot more amazing things with programming. Looking deeper into it, being self taught, it's going to take A LOT of discipline, motivation, and some INCREDIBLE amount of willpower (Since I'm burntout from a job I hate everyday) to achieve, and we go back to, I want it this type of career NOW. I don't have the mind to think long term. My brain wants things NOW. It's inescapable. I want so bad to quit this career, it would take away a lot of problems mentally, but I just can't deal with the financial uncertainty, and I have no degree or skillset outside of my current career to make enough financially to support my current lifestyle (I'm not rich or anything, I'm actually pretty frugal, but you know, bills, decent apt, and all). And there's no possible way I could possibly commit myself to self teaching myself a new career while devoting 8 hours of mental willpower to a career I already hate,everyday. It's an endless loop. I don't know what to do. I thought about a career counselor, but the one time I've been to a counselor, it did me fuck all but stick me with a $200 bill and zero help. I'm so lost. I feel like every time I go to work it takes a little more of my soul. It's lead to me not taking care of myself physically (Again, no willpower after an 8 hour day), kills any \"fun time\" I have after work because I just think about having to go back the next day, etc. The 4 day weekend I just had was amazing. Got some little things done in the apt, had some discipline/motivation to code some basic HTML/CSS since I wasn't worried about having to go to work the next day, etc. But now it's back to work, and I'm forever stuck in this whole endless loop of wanting to leave work, but not getting myself mentally able to. Sorry for the rant, I don't even know if all this shit makes sense. I just let it all out as I went. Thanks for reading.",

Now im addicted to those games:) ) So today i had for the first time problems to beat a boss. It was Saika Magoichi. (NG) And then i activated for the first time the feature to invite a player to your party. Of course he one shot him. And i really like that funtion and i liked more that there is still gamers that still play this game. Because after 3-4 minutes i lost hope that someone will join . But at last someone joined and helped me alot. I know i may sound wierd but i just had to say that lol (My english is not so well so sry for that)",

I want to be pounded and slammed so deep and hard It'll remold my insides around it so that I never forget such a girthy superior rod.\" And who can blame you, the thought of being drilled by something so impressive that it'll send your body convulsing after each thrust, causing your eyes to roll back and your tongue to hang out the side of your mouth completely against your will through sheer pleasure alone. I'm talking about something that for the first time in your life has you thinking \"It's so much, i can't take it...\" yet before you even finish that thought forces you to orgasm preventing you from denying it, made to take it until your mind goes blank and you come to love It's dominating presence inside of you.  #160; And that is essentially what I'm looking to role-play tonight, the act of you submitting to this massive cock, having never experienced such an immense amount of meat filling you up in places no man ever has before and how you'll react, will you become a slave to it? worship it? beg it to never stop fucking you? how far are you willing to go in order to allow it's giant girth to continue it's assault against your body and your once tight innocent holes, cheat on your boyfriend/husband every chance you get? entice it by letting it cum inside you over and over again even should it impregnate you? give up your job, your entire life just to be used by it day to day? I'd love to find out. If you have an Idea in mind for a prompt please let me know, the basic Idea i have for a scene would involve you, ideally a naive young women who's never had anything remotely of this size, only to be dominated either by non-con or preferably dub-con, I love the idea it's sheer buldging thickness could entice you, cause you to get moist just at the sight as you imagine how such a thing might feel rampaging inside of your tight holes, to the point you'll gladly let it use you, it's not technically cheating if you don't say yes right? you're just not saying no either...  #160; I also want to add I'm looking for realistically massive by actual extreme standards, so ideally around 12-18 inches long something that could definitely exist for real just rare, not unrealistic anime sized cocks.  #160; Not looking for much build up, would prefer to just right into it and see where it goes, far to often people spend hours building up to something that never pays off, so if we enjoy some good smut and you wan't to continue the story and build things up afterwards, I'm all for it, but I don't like wasting hours on setting something up which yeilds no pay off. Major kinks: Huge cocks/huge cock worship, gangbangs, rough/hardcore sex(Hair pulling, spanking, spitting, slapping, light beatings, restrained/man handling, etc) anal/ass worship, oral/messy blowjobs, light bdsm, fucked silly/mind break, cheating, dom/sub, pet play, cumplay, impregnation (more so the act of you getting knocked up and less of you gaining in size and all that) name calling/degradation and many more. Only hard limits are Scat  amp; gore/snuff. Hit me up with a message, bonus points with a description or picture of yourself or who you want to play as and if you have any further things to add like scene ideas etc, let's spend a little time setting up a quick scene then jump right into it.",

        "title": "    My Story",
        "content": "    Hello everyone, So my story began few years ago. I work in the sportsbetting industry for almost 3-4 years now. I love my job, I really do. I have been promoted several times and in a nutshell the career has been great so far and there is potential to grow more. At some point in my home country I ended a bad relationship and I felt like I needed a fresh start. To explore and see the world, well at least Europe in the beginning. On a sidenote I have drug problem, so I needed the change. My parents, brother and my therapist all encouraged it. Well you can not escape from yourself, right ? Indeed. At some point I started to bet myself. Bit by bit small amounts, you lose in the beginning, no biggie did not thought this would pose a threat. In my mind I have always laughed at the casino gamblers, why are they doing it ? The house always wins, it is stupid. I thought I was smarter, I work in the sports industry, sure I can beat the bookies long term. I am a very active person myself. Basically I breathe sports, this is the central theme of my life. Boy, I was wrong. Anyway fast forward a year and a half in my new country. I started to lose more, stakes were getting higher. I owed money to my friends I had some small loans and the monthly expenses were getting too much to bear. The salary was not that good to start with. I had to tell my family, because I was fucked when I blew my monthly salary in a matter of days, no money for food and I missed rent already. I was in a financial crisis and it was getting depressive. Then, eventually I found another job in another country. I landed a great position in the industry with a decent bonus and a salary. 1 month before I left I had a very good month in betting. I was 5k euro up. I felt really happy, surely now at last all that research and hard work has payed off. I have turned the tables around. No I did not. I had a downswing which I did not handle and I was back where I started again, broke. I owed even more money than I did by now. Missed the rent and the deadlines for the loans. Family helped again. It was sad, I have let them down again, I lied to them, I promised I would not gamble anymore and said everything was okay. It feels awful, 30 years old, completely broke asking your family to help you out, meanwhile you were lying to them and manipulating them. Also, I have let my friends down who I promised to pay back on time. Even though I have debt all together about 25k which is less than my yearly salary. If I would stop gambling I would live comfortably after few months when I have cleared the debts to my friends. The sad part is, I do not feel like I am able to quit or want to quit. I still truly believe that it is possible to win long term. For a fact it is, but who am I fooling I am a gambler, an addict, I am not winning right now. It is like an obsession already, I must prove to myself, to others. People think I am crazy. It is just so fucked up that I work in the industry, Even if I really wanted to quit gambling, I tried that, but it is always looking at you, the odds, the events. Imagine your a cocaine addict and everyday a line is in your desk, looking at you, everyday. Sorry, it is a long read and I am not a native speaker. I just needed to vent and share my thoughts and despair, because it just too depressing to tell my family again that I bust my salary. Managed to pay some of the bills, but not all. Few hours ago when I bust my bankroll I stand up from my desk and went to the bathroom and cried. Again, and again. It is like a never ending cycle. It is fucking depressing. Sidenote: I am dating this women from work and it has been going great, she is an amazing women. She might be the one. The other day she was asking what is my catch. \"You are too good to be true. There is always catch with men.\" Well I guess there is, if she only knew...",

They are also the first on the ship and the last off at port, so you'll have a small bit less time when you hit land. Going through the school is a bitch, and I wasn't able to cut it, failing the week before I was supposed to take Comp. Overall school's gonna be hell, and there's a reason so few people make it through. In addition, if you pass the first school then fail, you're either going Conventional MM or Yeoman, because you've already been rated as an MM at that point. If you fail out in a school, then you have the chance of picking up other things, like I did getting CTR after trying for an EMN. After school, you'll be definitely going ship right off the bat, and if you don't reinlist for a few more years after your first 6, also known as star re-enlistment, it will be difficult for you to hit E-5. Basically, the school's tough and you'll probably hate going though it. If you do fail, though, don't blame yourself too hard. For some people the way they teach you by forcing you to drink from a fire hose is just not a way you're able to learn. Now, CTI is interesting. Their school is almost as hard as nuke school, with you having to learn almost an entire other language, and yet again, drinking from a fire hose. A lot of people fail out of there as well, but I didn't get through the school, so I can't really say too much about what happens there. However, afterwards most of the time they work shore, getting brought to E-4 as soon as they get out of school, basically. Then they tend to work with other people in Crypto and Cyber, translating and analyzing SIGINT. After the navy both groups get good job oppurtunities, with the nuke having a secret clearence with extremely good technical training and people know you're good at learning if you were able to pass nuke school. On the other hand, CTI has good training as well, with a Top Secret clearence instead of just a Secret one, as well as they are probably going to be working at a 3 letter agency in the intelligence field, meaning you can go to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Homeland Security, as well as work as a contractor, all of which pay extremely well. People are also willing to train you if you aren't fully trained for the job they want you to do if it requires a TS clearence, because it's better for them to pay a few thousand for training you than pay 500,000 for a TS clearence for someone right from college.",

She rocks up with a custom dark purple board, and already I'm feeling like she knows what she's doing. What followed was about 10 minutes of almost surreal skil in the sport. She glided through the air, twisting, spinning, flipping, and she landed like a feather on the water. I just sat there, jaw on the deck. Finished up the session and she hops in the boat, tangled bruennte hair, hazel eyes, tanned skin, delicate muscle definition, and she looks at me, without a hint of arrogance, she asks \"what do you think?

Prydain is probably fine. Redwall, as has also been suggested, is also excellent. Beyond this, though, I think there's lots of opportunity to be exposed to a lot of different cultures and ideas now, more so than when I was a kid. There's lots and lots of amazing books about myths and folktales from different parts of the world that express a wider outlook than just white, male European. My recent favorite is a picture book called \"Kindness\" full of Buddhist and Asian folk tales and gorgeous illustrations.

My current good Servants besides her are Heracles, Ushiwakamaru, Emiya, Seigfried, Prototype CuLancer, CuLancer, Medea, Jing Ke, Mephistopheles, Romulus, Kiyohime and CuCaster. Currently Atalanta has a lvl 4 Leyline CE which gives 50% NP (no Sakura or Kaleidoscope sadly) and Ushiwakamaru has the 4 star maids CE (increase NP rate). Was considering putting a lvl 4 Bazette CE on Atalanta to make her a crit goddess, but unsure. I was thinking of putting her with an Assassin partner, but Mata Hari sucks apparently (even though she's super waifu material) and I hate Jing Ke's art. Any suggestions? (Also kinda unrelated but what does leveling up an NP do besides giving it the ability to overcharge? Does it deal more damage or something?)",

        "title": "    A Complete Guide to Sophomore Transfer",
        "content": "     #8203; Basically I wanted to write this because there is wayyyyy less information regarding the transfer process compared to regular freshman admissions. I went through the process this past admissions cycle and I feel like it would help people if I sort of outlined the steps that I went through, what I learned, what I would do differently in hindsight, etc. Also note that I am writing this in the context of one being a sophomore, but I #8217;m rather confident that it is the exact same process as a junior transfer, probably the only difference being the letter of recommendation section because you will have more time to gather them from professors. **Background** Before I go into the process, I thought it would make sense to tell you a little about my background. As a freshman I attended a large, private city school in the east coast (think NYU, BU, etc) where I was a CS major. The schools I applied to were Cornell, Vanderbilt, UPenn, and Northwestern. I was accepted into Cornell, Vandy, and Northwestern and rejected by Penn. I applied into the engineering schools of Vandy and Northwestern, the college of arts and sciences at Penn, and CALS at Cornell. Also might be worth saying that my high school stats were probably good enough to be somewhat competitive to these schools as a freshman admit. **Why do you want to transfer?** I think that the first step anyone looking to transfer should do is really solidify and articulate why they want to transfer. For some people, this is going to be really easy. If you hate your current school because you thought you would love living in the city but realized you hated it for example, then that is your reason. If you thought you wanted to do computer engineering but ended up wanting to do psych but your current school doesn #8217;t like psych, then that is your reason. For other people, however, it will not be as easy. I happened to absolutely love the school I went to as a freshman. As in if I got rejected by all four schools I applied to I still would have been incredibly excited to spend the next four years at that school. The only reason I was applying to these schools as a transfer is because some of them had better computer science programs and I knew that transferring to one of these more  #8220;elite #8221; schools would probably help me later on with job search etc. Obviously, you cannot just write in your essays that you would like to transfer to Penn because you saw it was ranked high via US News. In this case, you have to spend a lot of time researching the specific programs at each of the schools and mold your experiences and interests to those programs. Convince the school that their unique programs or courses of study align perfectly with what you want to do. I will talk more about this when I discuss essays a little later in the guide, but I listed this section first because it is probably the hardest and most time consuming. The earlier you can start figuring out (**and writing down**) your specific reasons for transferring the easier you find the essays. **Make a list of transfer schools** Honestly this probably the easiest part of the entire process. Figure out where you are going to want to actually apply. No real systematic way to do this, understand the type of school you want to go to and look at transfer statistics. I will say that the  #8220;top tier #8221; schools that happen to be rather transfer friendly are Vandy, Cornell, Northwestern, and, to a lesser extent, Brown, Columbia, Penn. Again, do your own research and do what makes sense. This sub is a good place to ask about specific schools and to get general advice about where you should apply. **Freshman year at your college** Work really fucking hard. That #8217;s about as long as this section probably needs to be. I am obviously not an admissions officer or anything like that, but based on anecdotes I have heard and my own experiences it seems like transfer admissions is a lot more based on your raw stats, particularly for top schools. Get as close to a 4.0 as possible. Also, make a lot of friends and do fun stuff because it's college and if you #8217;re not doing that you are severely missing out. I wasn #8217;t too involved in student organizations, but I definitely joined and participated in a few. Don #8217;t have too much to say here. Would probably be best if you joined some pertaining to your major, academic interests, etc, but personally don #8217;t have a bunch of experience or stories here so can #8217;t speak too much on the topic. I would say your academic performance is a lot more important than stacking your application with a list of hundreds of clubs that you joined. **LETTER OF RECOMMENDATIONS** This section is capitalized. That #8217;s because this is really fucking important so I hope you #8217;re writing this down or something. For all of the schools I applied to (except Cornell which required one), you needed two letters of recommendation from college professors. I know what you #8217;re probably thinking: that's no big deal, I had to do that for freshman admissions in high school. You thought wrong. This is where it is so incredibly important to think ahead and plan this stuff out. As I mentioned before, I went to a large school. As a freshman, I was mostly taking introductory level classes with sometimes hundreds of students in the class. There was a negative percent chance that the professor was ever going to learn my name to know who I was if I didn #8217;t take it upon myself to make sure they did. So, what does this mean for you? Well, you probably are going to take four or five classes the first semester. Ideally, both of your letters of recommendations come from professors in the first semesters (one of mine came from a second semester prof so it #8217;s not the end of the world if it has to happen, but I honestly wouldn #8217;t recommend that). First step is to select who you want to write it. If you #8217;re applying as a CS major, it would obviously make sense to choose a CS or math prof to write them. Use common sense. That #8217;s the easy step. Second step is to get them to know you by name and face. This is a lot harder than it sounds, especially at a large school. What this essentially entails is to ask a lot of questions and frequently go to office hours. Don #8217;t go to office hours the day before a test or the night before a problem set is due, the entire class will be there then. Go during calmer periods where there will be less people. Key here is to go even when you #8217;re not confused. First few weeks of college may not be that challenging academically, the material may still be fairly simple. Go to office hours anyway. Think of questions to ask that aren #8217;t direct or trivial, it lets the professor know that you are really thinking about the content and trying to apply to other areas, not simply robotically writing down what they are saying in lectures. Professors will appreciate that, and it will give them great things to write about when they are writing their letter of recommendation. Finally, professors are generally really nice people who will definitely be willing to help you out. I personally found it a little awkward to ask them to write me these letters after still not knowing me all that well, but all of them were very understanding and happily did it. Please please please please start early with all of this in terms of getting to know your professors. Give them PLENTY of time to write and submit the letters. This was the most stressful part of the process for me personally, and 90% of that stress could have been greatly alleviated if I had just started earlier. **Essays** At this point we are finally ready to start writing the actual essays. I certainly do not claim to be any sort of essay expert or anything like that so I #8217;m not gonna spend too much time here. There are plenty of sample transfer essays you can see online to get the general idea and vibe of that they are like. The two things that I would like to emphasize, however, are to make your essays (a) forward looking and (b) school specific. The forward looking part is mainly in reference to people who have specific reasons why they would like to transfer out of their current school. It may seem like the essays are a good place to bash your current school and talk about those reasons why you don #8217;t like it. Don #8217;t do that. Insead, focus on why you would do great at the school you are applying to. For example, if you go to X college and really wanted to study CS and Art there but they didn #8217;t have an art program, don #8217;t write extensively about X #8217;s lack of art program (although you probably will want to mention it briefly). Instead, keep the majority of the essay focused on why school Y (the school you are applying to) is just so perfect because it has this awesome program that blends math and art blah blah blah you get the point. Next part is about being school specific. You probably already know this from freshman admissions, but you are obviously going to want to tailor each essay to the specific school you are applying to. This is often even more important in transfer essays. To highlight these two points in reference to transfer admissions, here is one of the essays I submitted to Northwestern. I would never call myself a great writer or anything and this essay certainly isn #8217;t anything special, but I do think I did a pretty good job here focusing on the two points that I stated above, which was keeping it (a) forward looking and (b) school specific. The prompt was essentially asking what parts of Northwestern can help me reach my goals.  gt;I look forward the most to taking advantage of two specific elements of Northwestern.  gt;  gt;The first is the strength of the Computer Science department #8217;s Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) faculty. As I detail in my other essay, I absolutely love developing mobile applications. This activity is what initially sparked my interest in Computer Science and continues to propel it. **(a)** Unlike at my current institution, which does not offer many courses or faculty involved in HCI research, at Northwestern I would be able to make it my concentration within Computer Science. Outside of coursework, **(b)** I would also benefit from Northwestern #8217;s Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) lab. This unique program allows students to receive mentorship from faculty and graduate students as they go through the full process of researching, designing, and prototyping their ideas. DTR would allow me to gain exposure to the formal research and development process as it pertains to technology.  gt;  gt;**(b)** The second is McCormick #8217;s CS+X initiative. I am particularly interested in this because of how inherently interdisciplinary mobile apps are. In particular, CS+X has been growing in the intersection between education and computer science. Two of the apps that I have created, \\[REMOVED\\] and \\[REMOVED\\], are education-based apps. I would love to be able to learn more and perhaps even conduct research through CS+X about how education can continue to progress through breakthroughs in computer science and software.  gt;  gt;Put simply, I believe that Northwestern has many resources that I will be able to take advantage of to reach my academic goals. McCormick #8217;s  #8220;whole brain #8221; approach fits in perfectly with my desired concentration of Human-Computer Interaction, where technology intersects with design.  gt;  gt;I tried to put (a) and (b) #8217;s throughout the essay where I thought it exemplified the points that I was talking about above. And, once again, it helps to start early with these. I waited until essentially the last minute to start some of my essays and it led to some very stressful days in the week before the deadline. Start early, and get feedback on it often. Feel free to PM me your essay and I can try to give you some feedback. Again, not a great writer over here by any means, but I can at least comment on the content #8217;s direction.

Feel free to PM me your essay and I can try to give you some feedback. Again, not a great writer over here by any means, but I can at least comment on the content #8217;s direction. **Important documents** This section is a lot less exciting but I feel like it may be helpful to know. You #8217;re going to need to file some documentation with your current school to get a few different things you need to send to schools to transfer. None of them are particularly difficult so I won #8217;t go into specifics, but college bureaucracy can make them take a while to get pushed through. So, as is a central theme in this guide, start early with this. Also, these documents can talk about misconduct, either academic misconduct or just general things, so don #8217;t get into too much trouble. Some schools ( #190; I applied to) will also require you to send a mid term report for your second semester. That is they will make you print out a sheet of paper and go to each of your professors to write down your  #8220;current estimated grade #8221; and their signature. Essentially the point of this is just to make sure you #8217;re not doing poorly in the second semester. Unfortunately, this is not senior year of high school, so you can #8217;t just go full steam first semester put in your application and then stop trying. **General advice (please read)** Just real quick, I want to try to give probably the most important advice in this entire guide: try to fall in love with your current school. This especially goes out to the kids who maybe didn #8217;t get into the caliber of school they thought they deserved to go to out of high school. I get it, that was my primary reason for transferring too. Out of this entire process the thing I am most proud of is how much effort I gave into giving my current school a fair chance, and I ended up absolutely loving. I can truly say that if I got rejected from all four schools I applied to (which easily could have happened; I think we all know how random these things are) I would have been incredibly excited to stay for the next three years. Don #8217;t be the kid who knows he #8217;s trying to transfer and therefore gives zero effort in clubs and takes no initiative to meet other people. I made some awesome friends that I know I am going to keep in touch with and I will be able to visit them every year. Pretty cool. I #8217;m gonna say it again: act like you #8217;re not transferring your freshman year. Treat it like you #8217;re there for the next four years. Please please please please. Do that and I promise you will not regret it. I think this hits all the main points. If anyone else who has already transferred realizes that I missed something, please let me know and I will add it to make this as complete of a guide as possible. Also if anyone who is going to be going through the transfer process is unclear about anything, feel free to ask about it. Like I said before, not a good writer, and I am sure some of this doesn #8217;t make complete sense.",

Whether it's karate or a concealed pistol, you should have some way to protect yourself. Because if you don't, you're powerless. You're weak, and completely at the mercy of people who might want to hurt you. The only thing you can do is call the cops and hope. Sure, you with a concealed pistol versus a mall shooter with an assault rifle has very long odds, but at least your fate is in your own hands.

        "content": "    In a post on twitter about a clip from the tv show Friends making fun of domestic violence against men. *(the man said \"She threw things. They hit me\" and the reaction of the audiance waq laughing)* a woman commented:  #8203;  gt;I think this **joke was based on a view that women being mad shouldn't be taken seriously**; like a child throwing a tantrum and objects, as if that's cute or something. On the other hand, I can see it as a poor taste in humor using domestic violence. Male victims of domestic violence are mocked, wich is sexism against men. but she framed the situation as sexism against women. It's like someone saying making fun of violence against gays is acctually bigotry against heterosexuals. This reminded me of this part from MEETING THE ENEMY A feminist comes to terms with the Men's Rights movement talk by Cassie Jaye (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY amp;t=153s amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks)) \\[ 6:46 ; 7:26\\]  #8203;  gt;I changed from making words in their mouths, to acknowledging the issues, but insisting they are women's issues.A men's rights activist would say to me \"a man is far more likely to lose their child in custody battle\" and i would counter \"because women are unfairly expected to be the caretaker, it's discrimination against women that women get custody more often\" Another example is when talking about forced conscription of men during world wars as an example of systemic sexism against men, people say \"women were not allowed to be in the army\" ! As if it's a privilege to be forced to die. as if the victims here is women not men. Why this happen ? For decades gender studies focused exclusively on women's rights but never **men's rights**, exclusively on misogyny but never **misandry**. people don't even know the word misandry. Our brains are biased, we interpret any sexist double standard as sexism against women, even sexism against men is considered sexism against women. # Acknowledging anti male sexism and female privilege: Mocking male victims of domestic violence is sexism against men, giving women the custody of the children just because she is a woman is sexism against men, forcing to die in war is sexism against men. In a lot of areas women are privileged. sexism against men is real. **female privilege** is real.",

My player argued that it isnt how it works and basically with enough time you can pass most any skill check. He is much more familiar with the game so I said ok you unlock it I guess.

I been trying to quit forever, this time I gotta make it work and idk why but I feel like I will as Im tired of this. Im on chapter 5 right now of the Allen Carr book (audio version) and I must say that for some reason it makes me feel so confident that I will succeed this time about this whole gambling problem situation that I have going on. I want nothing else but to quit tbh, thats all that matters to me right now. My longest streak was 31 days or so last year and I remember how happy and calm I felt back then.. regardless this time ima crush that like its nothing. I will keep you guys updated. If I can do this then you can do it too. I cant wait to be 100 days clean. That would be like a dream come true. I cant wait to look back at this post and be so mad happy about it, and proud!",

It says he has 56K and I can sell him anything but when I do, it makes the gold sound and my gold count at the bottom of the screen doesnt change. I save, reloaded, backed out of conversation, trained more, didn't train...everything I can think of. Still shows that he has 50K+ gold but unless I buy something from him (thus increasing the amount he has) I can only sell back the worth of that item. This is weird...",

        "content": "    Hello guys, I am on day 4 cold turkey i'm 25y/o male, i relapse 3 months ago after 6 years of gamble free thanks to online gambling, in this time i lost more than half of my savings i did in 5 years working a low paid part time job and i really struggle to save believe me, anyways it's not about the money but mostly my mental health in this 3 months, last week was the last straw for me after I realize this must stop cause I can't control myself like I did years before, so last week after a long losing streak i made a deposit 200 and begin to play some online roulette like I usually do and after 2 hours with my face in the screen I look at my balance it was 5k, I feelt amazing as I got back some of my losses so i cash out, next day waking up smiling I deposit (of course) 500 without breaking a sweat, this time to another casino and to my surprise I hit all of my lucky numbers again so I was on another winning streak! My balance this time was 7k! Time to cash out and quit gambling I said to myself, cause I promise before I would if I have this kind of luck to get my money back. So I requested the withdraw but this site required verification if you withdraw money from them and even after that it takes 2-3 days before I see it on my account, nothing new to me I just needed to send them papers next day. So as you know you can cancel the withdraw at any time, so I did that night and won another 3k!!! My balance was 10k, I feelt like nothing can stop me!!! and thought I can do this forever............nope. that night i cancel the withdraw and start getting greedy by betting big, after a short time 0 balance and it only get worse, the next 2-3 days I began the chase with the other 5k I won, only this time I withdraw amounts directly from my bank account and losing everytime to the point I lost that 5k plus what was left, I feelt depressed before like everybody but the last days I feel like never before depressed, everything I do feels so exhausting I wake up wishing I haven't, work seems like I'm moving weights cannot concentrate on nothing thinking on how I can be so dumb and selfish, that's why this Monday i nationaly exclude myself from all gambling online and in stores so I don't auto destroy myself later.",

If I were to give a suggestion for how to improve, it would be to take your channel in a drastically different direction. For one thing, you could maybe add _value_ to the work you produce. You could, for example, go for commentary (adding further comments, elaborations, thoughts, facts, figures, etc.) to things you read, or critique things you read.",

Blood, sweat, and tears working for that money I saved and now it feels like all for nothing. Somehow....I got involved with this bad habit and blew my entire savings. I'm so disgusted and sick that I had to come on this community to post and feel sorry for myself. The pain is too much, I don't even have the motivation to go to work any more or even try to save all that up again, it'll take me a veryyyy long time I don't even have the spirit to do it. I just want to lay in bed all day now depressed. It's crazy how it takes so much work and time to build up that much money but only a blink of an eye to blow it all instantly. This definitely sets me back a year or two of whatever goals I had for myself. Truly sickening. I think at this point I need to find my happiness back and get my mental right. It's going to be a long time till I shake this off...... Please.......any encouraging thoughts......let me hear them.......",

        "content": "    So, first off, I haven't tried/seen posts like this, so if this isn't where they go, let me know and I'll repost as needed. Tonight I was playing with two buds on Standalone. We decided to jump on a 30+ server and run around Berezino looking for action. We sat there at the hospital for fifteen minutes- nothing. Well, until one of us decided to practice diving off the roof. Broken legs, bleeding, but he survived and I patched him up. Server reset immediately after. This is where things got shitty. Logged into another server and he was still broken and bleeding. A zombie came up, sneezed, and he died. I grabbed his shit, threw it on the ground and guarded it as he made his way back, dying before he could from a zed. We decided to meet him halfway for the second attempt at the police station east of Berezino. Halfway there, he tells us he's at the station- and there are three geared guys below him (he's on roof). So we flank the station, I get in the bar across the street and my buddy watches the side door while the third just whimpers on the roof. Ten minutes of watching them slaughter Bambis as the run in. Once or twice I shouted in DC or shot at their feet to get them to leave the station, but they ran in anyway. Well, that gave away my position fast and two of them began flanking me. Killed one and wounded the other, who we presume logged because he was no where to be found after. The third stayed in the station and was killed when the buddy on the roof snuck down, punched him in the face, and ran back to the roof, giving me a clean shot when he followed. Well, we looted the bodies of the two we could and discovered mags with 7e(insert-numbers) ammo. Interesting. While we were in the station, we heard more shots from outside. I went to the roof to check, and saw a bambi running, bleeding. I shouted for him to get in and got out my bandages, asking where they were. He answered with a fist to my face, which ended with two M4s unloading into him (Bambis, learn from this man). Went back up to see if I could see them. Nope, but they saw me. Shitton of gunfire later, I was unconscious, screaming over teamspeak for bandages so I don't die. Everything was ruined, no bandages to be found. Somehow, magically I revived before bleeding to death and killed another bambi trying to knock out my bud as he was digging in his inventory for something to heal me with. Couldn't find anything, so, now legally color-blind, ran to the nearby apartments for a quick bandage thanks to a shirt found on a body along the way. From there we decided to bug out via the hospital, hoping our first companion's death-loot was still there. To our surprise, his pack was, with all its contents. Geared back up as much as possible after discarding all my ruined garments (all but pants and weapons, more or less) and took off for the woods. Halfway there, our friend who was on the roof providing overwatch cries out that he fell off the roof trying to go down the ladder. Laughing hysterically, we loot his body as he logs for the night and sprint out of that deathtrap. Once we were sure it was safe (ten mins of running straight away) we logged, laughed a bit, and decided tomorrow we shall hunt deer instead of men. Maybe not an epic story, but I was physically shaking with adrenaline for most of this encounter, which lasted the better part of an hour. I love DayZ tl;dr- Bud died, got trapped in police station on way back, standoff and firefight with guys in station, asshole bambi, defied death in second one-sided firefight, escaped, skydived off hospital",

I'm not sure I'm wise enough to answer those questions, but the Catechism of Pope Pius X (which, according to wikipedia, Cardinal Ratzinger supported) has this Q amp;A:  gt; 80 Q. If a penitent is not certain of having committed a sin must he confess it? A. If a penitent is not certain of having committed a sin he is not bound to confess it; and if he does confess it, he should add that he is not certain of having committed it. I think there are some smarter folk around this sub who can confirm/deny the validity of this catechism (I'm a little ignorant about this kind of thing), but it seems to address your first question pretty comprehensively except for the invalidation part (no idea about that, sorry). I hope someone can offer good advice for the second question, if not perhaps you can ask your priest next time.",

I've suffered with anxiety/panic for years now.. haven't been diagnosed with anything else ie Narcolepsy, psychotic illness etc. Recently, i started recognising faces everywhere.. i was always able to 'reality check' them so to say.. ie take a closer look and realise that i am mistaken. I am very good with recognising faces in films, people from my childhood etc. But this lead to extreme anxiety.. the worst 'period' i've ever had. Complete derealization for a few days until my anxiety subsided. I feared that i had developed psychosis so badly that i went to see a psychologist to be reassured that i was fine however this continues to happen infrequently. I have had MRI/CT of the brain so there isn't anything nasty there. I'm putting it down to yet another symptom of my generalised anxiety disorder :) Let me know if you find out anything more!

        "content": "    Name: Coward? Alignment: Neutral Benign Attack: None Defense: None Unique Role: No Abilities: The first time you are attacked or visited by someone, you will become their alignment. Attributes: none. Mechanics: (How It Works) Say that Person 1 Is the coward role. They are this role until they are visited or attacked for the first time. When they are visited, a message will pop up saying something along the lines of  #8220;You have been visited by a(n) -Insert role here-! You pleaded for your life and have become an -insert alignment of the thing that attacked or visited you-! #8221; For example, say you are attacked N1 by Mafioso. You will not die; instead, your name will then change to red and you will know all the mafia members. You cannot contribute to killing or framing or anything like that, but your alignment will change, giving mafia an extra vote. This also applies if you are visited by a town visiting role, except you dont know who town all is obviously. If you are visited by multiple people N1 who are of different alignments, your alignment will always turn into whatever is attacking you (no matter how many town visit you). In the rare case that you get attacked by multiple people, you will have an even chance for conversation into them. \\-Investigative Results-Sheriff: Your Target Is A Coward! Investigator: If the investigator is the first one to visit the coward, Coward will show up as Invest/Consig/Mayor. Otherwise, they will show up as the role that attacked/visited them first (EX, if they were visited by mafioso, They will show up as Vigi/Vet/Mafioso. If they are visited by SK, they would show up as Doc/Disg/SK, Ect) Consigliere/Witch: Your target will plea for their life when visited. They must be a Coward! Goal: Become a Different alignment and complete their goal. Wins With: Whatever Alignment they turn into. Must Kill: See Above. Anything else: If you visit a coward, and it is their first visit, you will get the message  #8220;You have visited a coward! #8221; otherwise, you will not. I'm usually not a fan of conversion role ideas, but I think this is balanced and could benefit both town and evils. **Thoughts?**",

My legs didn't feel limbered/warmed up so to speak. I got under the weight for the set and it didn't feel right however I know I can squat it. I did the 5x5 but I didn't feel warmed up enough. I used to do a lot more warmup sets in the past until I read they should be sparse on SL website. What do you think?",

The very first night sleeping at home, the place I grew up and always felt comfortable in, I spent hours trying to get myself to sleep and ended up sleeping but for about an hour maybe and woke up crying my fucking eyes out. I have had recurring nightmares of some incidents that happened out there. Went to the VA for help and they basically told me I had to relive my experience in order for me to get better. That's a bunch of bullshit. What helped me was staying busy, wearing myself out. I was in school full time, had a part time job and constantly looking to learn new things, going to movies, finding a female friend, just learning how to approach people helps, the gym is a sanctuary for me, hopefully for you as well. If your school has a VA center I recommend socializing there a bit. This really helped me a lot and still is. Keep in mind I still get nightmares from time to time and get in these mindsets that are hard to get out of but it's possible. You have to know where you are and that there are people here for you.

        "content": "    Hi Everyone, On behalf of me and my wife Id like to thank everyone in this room who have taken time out of there busy schedules to share this day with us it means a lot. I want to thank my parents for making me the man I am today, the values they instilled in me are present today and I will always be so grateful for that, and I also want to thank the Brathwaites for welcoming me as an extended member of their family. When I first met Lou It was actually for a job interview and little did I know at that time that we would now be sitting here as I didnt know all this was included in the role I applied for, and she certainly hasnt been paying me overtime thats for sure. Ill never forget how proud I was introducing lou to my family for the first time, it was in that moment I knew Id never feel this way about anyone else ever. As time goes on and life inevitably happens, I see how strong we become, any challenge or problem really is halved having this remarkable human as my life partner. I have loved you in the past I love you in the present and I will love you in the future. Please raise your glasses to us and I want to raise my glass to my wife and everybody in this room.",

It is the greatest protection in the world that goes beyond defending or reflecting, completely isolating its user in a world completely separate from the regular world.

        "content": "    Hi everyone, I'm 31yo and I've been gambling for 2 years now, exclusively on Blackjack. It started out with $300-500 buy ins. In March 2018, my lifetime total sunk to -13.5k. I was buying in for $3000 at times. I told my friends, and they made me swear that I'd stop going. I stayed away for 3 months, but started playing again in the summer. I would buy in several times a night (upto 8k), but eventually won back all my money (and was even up lifetime 6k) December 30th 2018, I went in about even on my lifetime. I lost more than I won and was down -6.5k over the next 2 weeks. On January 14th, I went in with 20k in chips (from my winnings across those 2 weeks), but managed to lose all 20k, plus 3.5k I took on my credit card that night. It was one of the worst nights of my life. I didn't want to wake up the next day. I felt so horrible. I decided to tell a new few people about the extent of my problem. All of them listened and were very supportive. I banned myself from my local casino for 1 year. I was down 28k in my lifetime. In March, I managed to win 3k at a casino in Detroit. I gained a little bit of hope. This week (April 8th), I was in Buffalo for work. The first night I won 7.5k. The next night, I'm up 5k, but keep playing and lose that, plus the 2.5k I bought in. I lose another 2k cash I brought. I take out 6k across my bank and credit cards and lose that as well. I go back to the hotel room for the remaining 5.5k from the night before's winnings. Lost that all well. That night alone, I lost 16k. I went back the next day, trying to win some back but lost 3k. Over 3 nights, I lost 11.5k of my money. **Here is where I stand:** 38k in total gambling losses \\~2k left in my bank account \\~5.5k on my credit card (3k from gambling) I have a good paying job (no other debt) and I live with my parents. They know I gamble (from mailings) but don't have any idea how bad it is. No one in my immediately knows. The most anyone knows is the 3 people I told about my losses in January. Over the next 2.5 months, I need to pay off my credit card (recovery) and start saving again aggressively (rebuild). I could realistically be back to 25k in savings (same as I had in December 2018) by June 30th, 2020. If I get back to that amount and never gamble again, I could consider this a (very, very painful) lesson.  **My fears are these:** Never really overcoming my addiction, but losing more money as I keep earning. Never overcoming this loss, letting it affect my happiness for the foreseeable future. Waking up one day when I'm 50 years old, feeling the same as I feel right now. Only then, I'd have access to much more money, and my actions would affect my future wife and kids. Losing my job (a lot of layoffs at my company this year) and having no nest egg to fall back on.   Thank you for reading this far. I spoke to a counselor earlier this year but I've found that hearing about other people's stories is the only thing that makes me feel better. Please feel free to share any advice for a) overcoming this huge loss b) feeling better about the future c) not giving in to more gambling. I appreciate you all. **TL:DR** lost almost 40k this year, trying to rebuild but in fear of depression and relapse.",

I used to push not thinking abt kills when I was playing mm. Now when I'm playing other role, still I'm one to push apart from my minion friends. The mm's don't even care abt pushing. When I get a kill or two in my lane the mm's leave their lane and come and join me in killing only to steal the kill of the enemy whose health is almost reduced by me. Even after killing they don't push with me. They go to different lane and do the same or go after the creeps. I'll tell you an example: I played yesterday with Dyrroth and my team was me, roger, alucard, tigreal and alfa. We lost all the towers except the inhibitor ones. Luckily in a team fight the enemy was wiped out in mid-late game. But after that only me and roger were pushing, rest went to farm. I was like Seriously!!! The enemy were wiped out and their mid lane inhibitor turret was destroyed what's the reason for farming at this point. We eventually lost the game due to that this mistake.",

At this point of time your fanbase is more or less saturated or probably increasing at a low rate. Your fanbase are the people who believe in space exploration. To increase your fanbase, you need to target people who are skeptic towards investing in space. By providing clean facts and figures this can easily be acheived.

        "title": "    [IWantOut] 28M Lebanon - gt; Canada/Germany",
        "content": "    I'm at a proverbial fork in the road and was wondering if anyone could help a Lebanese out with getting the hell out of this shithole. I'm a 28 year old electrical engineer who's been working for the past 3 years at a Lebanese-based oil and gas contracting company. I've managed to save up around 30,000 usd in my banks accounts, but due to the recent economic downfall and banks stealing our money and making wire transfers to other countries virtually impossible, I effectively only really have around 12,000 usd (cash I was able to withdraw painstakingly since the end of 2019) Germany: I have applied to and been accepted at 3 masters programs in Germany: One in sustainable systems engineering, one in cognitive science and the last in organic molecular engineering. I have just enough money to get the student visa ( min required is around 10,236 Euros or around 12,000 usd) Again, since the bloody banks will likely refuse my ability to wire transfer from my account, I can barely just make it with transferring the 12,000 usd in cash that I have on hand. The first program's tuition is around 1600 euros per semester while the other two have no tuition costs. So, basically, I've more or less got myself covered for these programs for one year, at least. (Not sure what to do for the second year when I'd have to renew my student visa, whether Lebanese banks would have started letting us wire transfer by then... Worst case I can try and get a part-tme job?) Canada: On the other hand, I have taken an assessment and eligibility test and found that I qualify for Canada's express entry under the federal skilled worker program. I did quickly added up the points myself based on what criteria I met and got a 74. (without a having done a french exam) Here's the conundrum: Should I go with one of the masters in Germany (with the plan on eventually securing a job after the masters) or go for permanent residence in Canada and then either pursue a masters at an affordable(?) state college (if I am able to afford it with my 12,000 usd) or try looking for a job based on my bachelors (American University of Beirut) and my 3 years experience. As a permanent resident, how feasible would it be for me to work part time in order to sustain myself with just 12,000 usd on hand? (to either look for work or apply to masters). Maybe it's worth mentioning that I'm currently at an A2 level of German. One last thing: I don't know how long I will last here. This is not to sound melodramatic, but the country is bouncing off the rails ever since the economic turmoil of 2019, civil unrest, banking system collapse, hyperinflation, COVID-19 pandemic and recent Beirut port explosion. State subsidies for wheat, fuel and medicine will likely be lifted within the coming three months and so the local currency will most likely plummet in value. So, given the above information, what would be the better choice? Thank you.",

        "content": "    Sorry for the long post but I really need some advice so please read until the end. Thank you. I've played every possible champion in jungle that won't get you reported (and by that I mean 10+ games for each champion, not just a couple of games) and Kindred is the worst by far. I've been playing Kindred since they came out and they are the 3rd champion I play most but I didn't get any better place than I was in 2 years ago. It feels more rewarding even to play Neeko jungle than playing Kindred right now. I always thought the problem was that I was a bad jungler but when I play any other jungler champion, I perform pretty well with a lot less effort. Kindred just doesn't feel worth the struggle. First of all, their early game is terrible. I mean really terrible. You can't afford facing enemy jungler alone because literally every single jungler in League of Legends can 1v1 and win easily against Kindred. And please don't be so quick to judge. I know how I am supposed to play as an marksman. Even if I dodge Lee Sin's Q or Elise's E and W or all of the Olaf axes and kite as good as possible, they are still able to win by just auto atack or run to safety in best case scenerio. So it seems imposible to contest for marks. Ganks are also pretty underwhelming. They might have the worst ganking potential among all junglers. Slow on E is just funny and Q's dash distance is not enough to be considered as a good gap closer. I don't even know why they gave a jungler 325 movement speed. Most of the time enemy laner can survive my ganks only by running straight, not even using flash. Only time I get a kill from ganks are counter ganks or when the enemy laner is literally under our tower. I am not even talking about how easy to kill a ganking Kindred... After all this struggle I changed my mentality and started playing like a Master Yi, Shyvana or Karthus jungle (which all of them have more healthy early game than kindred except Karthus but well he is not supposed to be a jungler) I've just farmed and get as many safe marks as possible in early game. But as I said eairler, I doesn't feel worth the effort. After surviving the terrible early game with the least amount of deaths, what do I have in my hands is nothing but a nerfed version of Vayne. And the worst thing about playing Kindred is, enemy jungler KNOWS how fragile you are. When I play Nocturne, Kayn, Udyr etc, enemy jungler rarely atempt to face me in jungle. But when I play Kindred, even if they are playing a champion like Sejuani or Zac which is not supposed to do counter jungle, they will enter my jungle and kill me in ease, not allowing me to even play safe and farm untill the late game. \"Get vision in your jungle\" is also doesn't work cuz I said, every single champion can 1v1 kindred so all I can do is to beg to my laners for help or watch them clearing my camps. I also watched a lot of videos about Kindred to improve myself and I couldn't spot anything special about the way they play. It might sound mean but most of the time, they just get some lucky early marks and kills purely by randomly being in correct place, at least that is what it seems to me. So, in conclusion, if there are any Kindred players who has a stable good KDA and win rate out there. Please share your secret. Because I am so close to give up on my thematicly favorite champion.",

        "content": "    I've been a gambling addict for around 5 years now. It started after a close friend of mine passed away and I went to the casino to escape reality. Over the years i've lost anywhere between $5 to 10k a year. With this whole Covid-19 quarantine thing going on, and the casino's being close, I found online gambling, which was recently legalized in my state of PA months ago. Over the past couple weeks I've been losing hundreds of dollars a week. I make around $400-500 per week from my job, which i am self employed. Last night was the final straw, I had around $200 in my account, I deposited $50 and said ok if i lose then im done. Well that $50 went quick, and then another, and another, and so on. Now I am negative -$350 in withdrawals that will be coming out of my bank on monday. The thing is with the online gambling they make it very easy to deposit with just your bank account, even if you don't have the money actually in there. I know its all my fault and i feel ashamed and embarrassed. I don't know what i'm going to do because I won't be able to get that much money in there in time when it clears my bank account monday, and i'll likely be given overdraft fees for each of the $50 transactions (7) that brought the account negative. What am i going to do???? I contacted the site i was playing on and told them that i wish to be self excluded and they closed my account. But now what?? I'm barely making it now and this was such a bad decision...... Why do i do this to myself...",

All updates are cumulative; you only need to install the most recent version to receive all updates. Update v1.3.1 (Released 1/9/2013) Added support for text input using the gamepad for Steam's Big Picture mode.

        "content": "    B4 i get to my point heres a very long back story (brace urself): When i was little i was the fat kid and a pretty tough one, always getting into fights (not tht its a good thing) but i was always proud of myself for never being soft. I was pretty good at basketball, martial arts and very passionate about music and til this day i still am. Although i was a lazy student wit the bad grades. But people actually saw me as a talented kid wit alot of potential. Found out about porn at age 8. In middle school i saw an interview of someone saying tht porn ruined his life. I was doin it almost every night bc i had trouble sleeping. Little did i know what it was doing to me. I never gave a shit about it til highschool bc it was my gym phase and it was taking alotta energy outta me. It took me a whole year to get skinny and im sure it was bc of pmo. The older i got, the softer i got. Every year that passed, my confidence was decreasing. I had trouble standing up for myself everytime i was bullied or disrespected and i knew i was capable of beating their ass. Ive become a pussy im not gonna lie. I wasnt the same kid tht fought for himself. And I blame pmo for tht. Thing about me is...im a pretty dark person. Ever since i was VERY little, i was violent. I was always angry, annoyed, depressed, and suicidal. In highschool i was still the same but i got into partying (not tht it changed anything), i was dating ALOT and made so many friends but i was still the kid going in n out of mental hospitals bc i was a danger to myself and others. Was told i was never gonna graduate so i stopped giving a shit about school, dropped out in senior year, moved to a not-so-good neighborhood, kicked it wit the wrong people and started doin stupid things that could probably get me killed or in jail. Fast forward 3 years. Now......im not suicidal anymore but ive been wayy more depressed than i usually am and ive been isolating myself for the past 2-3 years just kicking it wit a couple of my old friends. Havent been to a party 3 years now, stopped making new friends, and my dating life is nowhere to be found anymore. Im home almost everyday and ive become addicted to pmo. So i started nofap to get my old life back. The longest streak ive been on was about a good week and a half and im proud of that but lately, i relapse almost every 2-3 days and i just feel too guilty and unmotivated to go do anything productive. Bc of my addiction, i have trouble getting up in the morning (just sick of this reality), ive gained 30 lbs, brain fog is getting worse, been unemployed for over a year and havent worked on any music for a good month or 2. Ya...its tht bad. Now heres my question (sorry for my stupid life story lol) Do you guys really think nofap is neccesary or can i just cutdown to maybe once a week or two?? And for example if u were to relapse after a 5 day streak?? Is it a big deal? Can you still feel the benefits? P.s. pray for me that ill stay strong throughout my journey.  #128591; Ill pray for everybody in this community will stay strong.",

Students earn them basis their merit or need and do not need to repay. For me, I trust [www.buddy4study.com](https://www.buddy4study.com) for all my scholarship needs. They don't charge a penny and still I can search for hundreds of scholarships without falling in the burden of education loan debt.

I am due April 2021. pregnancy is very much stressing me out already and I am so early along. disclosure: I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, but it doesn't help that I do have actual diagnosed health conditions, such as pots (diagnosed via tilt table test), mild asthma, and thyroid disease (although in remission). I am a non smoker, am a healthy weight (120lbs), and am pretty active. I don't know why I think the worst is going to happen but here are some of the scary symptoms 1. heart fluttering. my heart feels like it's jumping out of my chest 2-3 seconds at at time. it so far has happened 6 times. It does go away and it's not constant but it terrifies me. my heart also isn't beating regular anymore! I read this is because of the blood flow to the baby, but my mind can't help but think more \"serious\" reasons. 2. shortness of breath. I am only 6 weeks but am already dealing with this. it does not help that I hyperventilated even before pregnancy (due to anxiety?). I also was told this was normal due to hormone fluctuating but I also keep thinking I'm going to stop breathing or have a heart attack. I don't know how I am going to survive the rest of it, and feel like I am annoying my doctors reporting every little symptom lol BTW: I'm not asking for medical advice, I just want people to relate to. Does anyone else feel this way, or have worsening hypochondria due to pregnancy?",

        "content": "    https://www.docdroid.net/P5plgTS/armamentalist-class.docx.html Hey, this is my first time on Reddit, and I'm trying to get some feedback on a Homebrewed class for 5th Edition. I'm trying to mimic the Armamentalist class of the Dragon Quest series. I got the inspiration while playing a campaign with my friends all at level 4. I am a monk in that campaign but I was fighting a stone golem of sorts and most of my weapons weren't doing nearly enough damage (I was using a quarterstaff) but our Rogue managed to shoot an acid arrow at it and do significant damage. It dawned on me that Monks are mostly physical based hitters and even with darts, they don't have any elemental properties if they take the monastic tradition \"Way of the Open Palm\" so I thought about the Armamentalists at one point, imbuing them with the elements to do additional damage and wondered if anyone had ideas. Above is a crude draft of what I have thus far. I'm still a new to DnD (Started with 4th edition) but any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Edit #1: I'm trying to make this class a bit more unique, and I know that I draw heavily from the Sorcerer class. What I'm requesting is feedback/suggestions regarding options, methods, or techniques on how to make this a bit more unique in and of itself.",

        "content": "    For the last 3-4 years I've been having these \"thoughts, visions, imagery\" of what I believe to be a female divinity who is chained by the hands and suspended in a cave like setting. This person has been at the forefront of my mind since a particularly negative event happened to me several years ago (something I can explain in PM if necessary) Nevertheless prior to that it seems this female was trying to warn me of the events that were coming...like I was already aware that the bad that was about to happen was going to happen. Then afterwards when desperately desiring justice for the wrongs done to me, this figure continued to dominate my mind as if to reassure me that someone was in my corner. This figure seems to be either white/pale or surrounded in light? Is both gentle towards me but appears to be full of wrath/ vengeance. There have also been times I have envisioned her with a staff or spear as a means of defense? Sometimes it seems like she is beckoning for me to release her...for what I am unsure. I've ran the full list of ancient deities this may be from Sumerian to Greek to Norse but I wanted some outside opinions. A small point of interest if important is that my background is heavily involved in the academic study of Philosophy. Not sure if that contributes anything to who this may be... I'm willing to elaborate further for anyone who feels like they have a serious inquiry as to who this is. I appreciate the help.",

        "content": "    Hi everyone, It's humbling to write this, but I have to accept my powerlessness to this disease, and engaging with a community of people with similar experiences seems to be a good place to start. My story is long and probably overlaps substantially with the prototypical story of a problem gambler.  phase 1: i became addicted to poker when i was in university. I attended a top Ivy League in the US, but I about half of my time there was lost to the illusion that I could win big playing poker. I did well playing live poker and truly became fascinated with the game, but something about online poker released my self-destructive/impulsive side. Overall, I won around $50,000 playing live poker, but probably lost around $75,000 playing online poker. Online poker made me a miserable person. I borke computers, gained 70 pounds, ***cut myself!****,* used a friend's credit card -- all to chase the rush. I can unequivocally say that it's been the most destructive force in my life thus far. Even had I ended up a winner at poker during that time period, I would still have been losing at the game of life. I forewent countless opportunities in the name of chasing a rush -- opportunities and life experiences that are only available when you're in that golden era of your life. I was honestly fortunate to have escaped gambling without having done more harm. My school was very attentive to all its students and their problems, and the support network/therapists in my place helped me cope with the addiction. while it occasionally resurfaced the first few years out of college, it was pretty much completely at bay for the last 10 years. phase 2: fast forward 10 years: two years ago, I moved to Los Angeles, the poker capital of the world. i was worried about the accessibility of gambling, but, when you're not in the throes of the disease, you forget how powerless it can make you. of course, i started playing poker again. at the beginning, i won big (around $30,000), but i lost a lot of it back due to bad play and bad luck. with the help of a therapist, i was finally able to stop for 6 months. of course, the bug came back, and about a year ago, i started playing seriously again. again, i did well at the casinos. over a 7-month time period, i won around $30,000. but it didn't feel healthy. i was consumed by gambling: i dreamt about it, i planned my life around upcoming poker tournaments, i watched whatever poker content i could on youtube, i gained weight, and i just became a slave to the game and the disease. i was able to justify all this because i was winning, but i knew that it was at least slightly problematic and that i was using it to escape larger issues in my life. phase 3: once the pandemic hit, i made what anyone who knows me would have identified as a terrible decision: *online poker*. i felt sorry for myself about the covid situation and played nonstop after work, and of course i lost $. instead of playing to make $ or to strategize, i played for the rush, jumping into stakes that i couldn't beat and playing variations of poker that have a lot of variance and could potentially lead to a big score. the big score never came, though. all that's come of the past 6 months is increased isolation, self-loathing, and $50,000 lost to online gambling. i've banned myself from every website, though there's one on which you can't ban yourself and on which i've consequently played a couple times the past two weeks. i've at least been responsible enough to not chase my losses, but the onslaught of losing and consequent self-loathing hasn't stopped, and i know it won't. i'm going to keep losing $, and worse, i'm going to let my days and youth be spent in pursuit of a gambling rush. i know poker isn't for me. i just don't have the right personality traits, and even if i did, i'm fortunate to have a business that earns me far more than i could ever expect to make from playing poker. i realize all of this intellectually, but this all goes out the window when cravings resurface. i want to stop, and i've been better about it, but it's just such a frustrating situation. i viscerally feel the urges, and sometimes i'm just too powerless to stop. i'm going to start seeing a therapist regularly and attending GA meetings. what's difficult for me is that i haven't really hit rock-bottom. and since i haven't, i'm able to justify to myself that i could play for a few hours on the weekend \"for fun\". but it all leads to the same outcome. i have to take this day-by-day and understand that it's not for me. and even if i'm not playing poker, watching videos and reading about it serves the addiction almost as powerfully as playing does. i guess i'm just at a loss. i'm sorry that i couldn't construct a more powerful or motivating message. i want to stop, truly, but i need to find a realistic way to achieve my goal. i think the only way there is baby steps: try to go an entire day without any poker content, and just build on it. this disease is neurological, and i know that with enough distance from it, the connections will weaken and my motivation will return. i'm going to do my best to post here every day. hopefully, this story resonates with someone. best of luck to everyone here.",

Eight moths later I was back in another hospital with a different cardiologist.

Cath showed two complete blockages and at third at 98%, including a widowmaker that the first quack had completely missed and never suspected for all those months. Triple bypass later, still waiting to see what improves and if some of the damage will reverse itself - a specialized test showed significant heart damage, but some of the tissue was dormant rather than completely dead and with restored blood flow might come back with extensive rehab. But for eight months I was a walking time bomb because the first guy didn't know what he was doing. I. am. pissed.",

        "content": "    IMHO \\(If you want an answer, because I personally don't really think Steins;Gate is anything beyond a good anime.\\)I don't want this post to be recognized as an \"I\\-art\\-holier\\-than\\-thou\" post, this was just me having fun criticizing an anime, of course, backed up with my own opinion. Who knows, it may help you know why Steins;Gate doesn't appeal to everybody \\^\\^! I hope you get some insight. 1.\\) I'm one of the shallow fcks out there, so I have may promiscuous taste on aesthetics, I'm gonna get straight to the point: I don't appreciate the character design of Okabe \\(because he looks unkempt, dirty, and edgy; I don't get how he's supposed to be \"handsome\" \\- per se, he isn't very admirable at first sight as an MC, which is a huge factor on why animes are popular and admired.\\) \\[Trust me bruh, social science and behavior isn't as amazing and profound as one would think\\]2.\\) I believe that the anime gambles on the fact on how people will capture and admire the sadness and troubles of the adventure; it's a one\\-trick\\-to\\-win\\-it\\-all\\-esque kind of thing, which is just layered with scientific complexities to make it look \"cool. For me, after 25 eps, it was like: \"Kay, you solved the main problem, and you had your suffering. Let's move on to another anime. \" 3.\\) The setting is modern Japan \\[looks plain as fck\\], TOPPED by..... normal characters and a trap. \\[Perhaps, I was interested in how these normal characters would develop that I swore that I would finish 25 eps.\\] 4.\\) The fanbase says it's one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, yet I'm blind to this notion. I may reconcile with the fact that the direction is superb, but I firmly believe that it had lackluster impact \\- it lacked the \"it\" factor, for me to truly dub it as a MASTERPIECE \\[I'm gonna expound on this in the kicker located at the last part of this exposition\\].For instance, Okabe's re\\-awakening as a mad scientist to try to save Kurisu \\(again\\) accompanied by a low\\-impact speech that was \\(SURPRISINGLY\\) admired by the viewers was a baffling phenomenon to me. HELLO? Did I miss something? I only saw him speaking like any normal person would when faced with something that HE MUST accomplish. It doesn't have much artistry or whatsoever, it didn't beautifully expound on the profundities of his philosophy on life, it's just a normal \"I'm gonna do this, because I'm crazy enough to do it anyway.\" Because of this, I don't think anyone has fully understood Okabe, and I don't care if this effect is intended or not. What made this series boom, IMHO, was just viewer interpretation attached to Okabe that is transforming him to something more than what he is: a simple, intelligent, and fragile character. 5.\\) Perhaps, because of the reason that I binged\\-watched all 25 episodes of Steins;Gate \\(plus the movie, so that makes it 26 portrayals, plus a little of Steins;Gate 0 now.\\) that I missed the development of admiration of the series due to sheer anticipation of what was going to happen next. I was desensitized to that specific phenomenal structure, and I watched it at the unintended pace which may have causated me to form a completely normal, dilute opinion on the series This is my real kicker: All throughout the series, I was constantly thinking about the question: \"What is in this anime series that accolades it to be one of the greatest of all time?\", and I didn't get a real answer. I got ample ounces of boredom for the first few episodes, got renewed faith that it will be good after ep 8 and above, and received a lackluster showing after finishing the series. The show may be so perfectly executed enough to be boring. It's like a computer with perfect calculation and execution, but no beautiful artistry behind its procedure. What you perceive as beautiful, in my opinion, was just the playing around with suffering. Fiddling with your funny bone to relate to your human suffering, making you think it's a genius portrayal. Well for me, it's not a masterpiece. It's good, but does not deserve to be the GOAT anime. TL;DR: It has superb execution, but it isn't \"beautiful\" enough \\[artistry and profoundness of philosophy was lacking\\] Results speak for itself why it isn't popular outside of Japan.",
